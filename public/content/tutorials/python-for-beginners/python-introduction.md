# 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a **popular programming language** used to tell computers what to do.

Just like we use English or Hindi to communicate with people, programmers use programming languages such as Python to communicate with computers.

Python is known for its **simple and readable syntax**, which makes it a great language for beginners.

![Python Programming Architecture: How Python Executes Across Web Development, Automation, and Data Science](/content/tutorials/python-for-beginners/images/01_What_is_Python.png)

### A simple example

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This small program tells Python to display:

```text
Hello, World!
```

That's it!

You have just written your first Python instruction.

> 💡 **Remember:** Python allows us to give instructions to a computer in a way that is relatively easy for humans to read and understand.

---

## 👨‍💻 Who Created Python?

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum**, a Dutch programmer.

He started working on Python in the late 1980s, and Python was first released publicly in **1991**.

Guido wanted to create a programming language that was:

* Easy to read
* Easy to learn
* Powerful
* Useful for different types of tasks

Today, Python is used by beginners, developers, data scientists, researchers, engineers, and many organizations around the world.

> ⭐ **Quick Fact:** Python was named after the British comedy group **Monty Python**, not after the snake.

## 🧠 How Does Python Work?

When we write Python code, the computer needs a way to understand and execute those instructions.

A simplified view is:

```text
Your Python Code
       ↓
Python Interpreter
       ↓
Computer Executes the Instructions
       ↓
Output
```

For example:

```python
name = "Rahul"
print(name)
```

Python understands the instructions and displays:

```text
Rahul
```

### What is an Interpreter?

An **interpreter** is a program that helps execute Python code.

You can think of it as a **translator between your Python instructions and the computer**.

> 💡 **Beginner Tip:** You don't need to understand Python's internal execution process in detail right now. For now, remember:
>
> **Python code → Python interpreter → Result**

You usually don't need to specify the type of a variable when creating it.

For example:

```python
age = 20
name = "Amit"
```

Python understands that:

```text
age  → number
name → text
```

You don't have to write the data type separately.

> 💡 **For now, just remember:** Python can determine the type of a value while the program is running.

We will learn variables and data types in detail later.

## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### 1. Case Sensitivity Trap (`Print` vs `print`)
Python is strictly case-sensitive. All built-in functions such as `print()` must be written in lowercase:

```python
# ❌ INCORRECT (Raises NameError: name 'Print' is not defined)
Print("Hello World")

# ✅ CORRECT
print("Hello World")
```

### 2. Mismatched String Quotation Marks
Strings must open and close with matching quotes (either single or double):

```python
# ❌ INCORRECT (SyntaxError: unterminated string literal)
print("Welcome to Python')

# ✅ CORRECT
print("Welcome to Python")
# Or:
print('Welcome to Python')
```

### 3. Forgetting Parentheses in Python 3
In older Python 2 code, `print` was a statement (`print "Hello"`). In modern Python 3, `print()` is a function requiring parentheses:

```python
# ❌ INCORRECT (SyntaxError in Python 3)
print "Hello World"

# ✅ CORRECT
print("Hello World")
```

## 🛠️ Try It Yourself: Hands-On Practice

Open an online Python interpreter or terminal and test these 3 beginner exercises:

### Level 1 (Easy): Your First Personal Introduction
Write a Python program that prints your name and your city:
```python
# Expected output:
# My name is Rahul
# I live in Shikohabad
```

### Level 2 (Medium): Direct Arithmetic Inside `print()`
Python can calculate mathematical results directly inside `print()` without quotes:
```python
print("25 * 4 =", 25 * 4)
# Expected output:
# 25 * 4 = 100
```

### Level 3 (Challenge): Multi-Line Card Design
Use multiple `print()` statements to print a neat terminal business card:
```python
print("================================")
print("       MSK CODING ACADEMY       ")
print("    Python for Beginners 2026   ")
print("================================")
```
