# Recursion in Python: Base Cases, Recursive Steps, & Call Stack Unwinding

In computer science, **recursion** is a problem-solving technique where a function solves a complex task by **calling itself** with smaller, simpler inputs. Instead of attempting to solve the entire problem in one monolithic loop, recursion breaks the task down until it reaches a trivial subproblem that can be answered immediately.

Recursion mirrors mathematical induction: if you know how to solve the simplest baseline case, and you know how to reduce an $N$-sized problem to an $(N-1)$-sized problem, you can solve for any $N$.

## Real-World Analogy: Channapatna Wooden Nesting Dolls & The Barber Shop Mirror

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      RECURSION REAL-WORLD ANALOGIES                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. CHANNAPATNA / RUSSIAN NESTING DOLLS (Matryoshka):
     - You hold a large painted wooden doll in your hands.
     - You open Doll #4 -> Inside is Doll #3.
     - You open Doll #3 -> Inside is Doll #2.
     - You open Doll #2 -> Inside is Doll #1.
     - You open Doll #1 -> Inside is a tiny, solid wooden figure that
       CANNOT be opened.
       * This is the **BASE CASE** (the stopping condition).
     - Now, you snap the shells back together in reverse sequence:
       Doll 1 into Doll 2, into Doll 3, into Doll 4.
       * This is the **UNWINDING PHASE** of the call stack!

  2. THE SALON / BARBER SHOP OPPOSING MIRRORS:
     - When you sit between two parallel mirrors, the reflection reflects
       the reflection infinitely.
     - Without a physical barrier or end (a base case), the loop continues
       indefinitely into infinity.

## Visual Architecture: Call Stack Winding & Unwinding

Let us trace the execution of `factorial(4)` through the Python Call Stack:

```
================================================================================
                    CALL STACK WINDING & UNWINDING PHASES
================================================================================

  WINDING PHASE (Pushing Stack Frames):
  factorial(4) calls 4 * factorial(3)          [Stack: factorial(4)]
    -> factorial(3) calls 3 * factorial(2)      [Stack: factorial(4) > (3)]
      -> factorial(2) calls 2 * factorial(1)    [Stack: factorial(4) > (3) > (2)]
        -> factorial(1) hits BASE CASE!         [Stack: (4) > (3) > (2) > (1)]
           Returns 1 immediately!

  UNWINDING PHASE (Popping & Resolving Arithmetic):
  factorial(1) returns 1                --> Stack pops (1)
  factorial(2) computes 2 * 1 = 2       --> Stack pops (2)
  factorial(3) computes 3 * 2 = 6       --> Stack pops (3)
  factorial(4) computes 4 * 6 = 24      --> Stack pops (4)

  Final Answer Handed Back to Caller: 24
================================================================================
```

## 1. The Two Pillars of Every Recursive Function

Every valid recursive function must possess two non-negotiable components:

1. **The Base Case (Stopping Condition):** An explicit conditional check that halts recursion and returns a concrete answer without making further recursive calls.
2. **The Recursive Step (Reduction):** The line where the function calls itself, passing modified arguments that move **strictly closer** to the base case.

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Classical Factorial (n! = n * (n - 1)!)
# ==========================================================

def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Computes factorial of non-negative integer n using recursion."""
    # 1. Base Case: 0! = 1 and 1! = 1
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
        
    # 2. Recursive Step: n * factorial(n - 1)
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print("Factorial of 5 (5!):", factorial(5))  # 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
print("Factorial of 1 (1!):", factorial(1))
print("Factorial of 0 (0!):", factorial(0))
```

**Output:**
```text
Factorial of 5 (5!): 120
Factorial of 1 (1!): 1
Factorial of 0 (0!): 1
```

---

## 2. The Danger of Missing Base Cases: `RecursionError`

If a recursive function lacks a base case, or if its recursive step fails to move toward the base case, the function calls itself indefinitely. 

Python protects system memory from crashing by enforcing a **maximum recursion depth limit** (typically 1,000 stack frames):

```python
# BROKEN CODE: No base case!
def infinite_countdown(n):
    print(n)
    return infinite_countdown(n - 1)

# Calling this will trigger:
# RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

### Inspecting and Modifying Recursion Limit:
You can inspect the recursion limit using the standard `sys` module:

```python
import sys
print("Default CPython Recursion Limit:", sys.getrecursionlimit())
# sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)  # Use with caution!
```

---

## 3. Practical Recursive Examples

### Example 2: Sum of Digits of an Integer
Calculate the sum of all digits of a number: $482 \rightarrow 4 + 8 + 2 = 14$.
- Base case: if $n < 10$, return $n$.
- Recursive step: `(n % 10) + sum_of_digits(n // 10)`.

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Recursive Sum of Digits
# ==========================================================

def sum_of_digits(n: int) -> int:
    # Base Case: Single digit number
    if n < 10:
        return n
        
    # Recursive Step: Last digit + sum of remaining digits
    return (n % 10) + sum_of_digits(n // 10)

print("Sum of digits in 482:  ", sum_of_digits(482))
print("Sum of digits in 9999: ", sum_of_digits(9999))
```

**Output:**
```text
Sum of digits in 482:   14
Sum of digits in 9999:  36
```

---

### Example 3: String Reversal via Recursion
Reverse a string recursively:
- Base case: empty string or single character string is already its own reverse.
- Recursive step: last character + `reverse_string(all_characters_except_last)`.

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Recursive String Reversal
# ==========================================================

def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    # Base Case: Empty or 1-character string
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return s
        
    # Recursive Step: Last character + reversed remainder
    return s[-1] + reverse_string(s[:-1])

print("Reversed 'INDIA':  ", reverse_string("INDIA"))
print("Reversed 'PYTHON': ", reverse_string("PYTHON"))
```

**Output:**
```text
Reversed 'INDIA':   AIDNI
Reversed 'PYTHON':  NOHTYP
```

## 4. Recursion vs. Iteration (Loops)

| Feature | Recursion | Iteration (`for` / `while` Loops) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Termination** | Base case reached. | Loop condition evaluates to `False`. |
| **Memory Overhead** | $O(N)$ auxiliary stack memory (stack frames). | $O(1)$ constant auxiliary memory. |
| **Execution Speed** | Slightly slower due to function call push/pop overhead. | Noticeably faster in Python. |
| **Best Suited For** | Tree traversals, nested dictionaries, JSON structures, divide-and-conquer. | Linear sequences, numeric counting, simple filters. |

> [!TIP]
> **When to Use Recursion:** For simple linear arithmetic, loops are faster and safer. However, for **hierarchical and branching data structures** (such as directory folder trees, organizational hierarchy charts, or XML/DOM parsers), recursion produces vastly simpler and more elegant solutions than nested loops.

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts Best Practices

| Best Practice (DO) | Dangerous Anti-Pattern (DON'T) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO** verify that your base case executes and handles boundary inputs (like $0$ or negative numbers). | **DON'T** write recursive functions without an explicit stopping base case. |
| **DO** ensure the arguments passed to recursive calls **strictly advance toward the base case**. | **DON'T** use recursion for simple loops (like counting to 100); loops are faster and use $O(1)$ memory. |
| **DO** be mindful of Python's default 1,000 recursion frame limit. | **DON'T** implement naive recursive Fibonacci without memoization, as it causes $O(2^N)$ exponential slowdowns. |

## Quick Revision Summary

- **Recursion** occurs when a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
- The **Base Case** is the critical halting condition that prevents infinite execution.
- The **Recursive Step** reduces the problem size and moves toward the base case.
- During execution, the Call Stack **winds** (pushes frames) until the base case is reached, then **unwinds** (pops frames and calculates results).
- Missing base cases trigger a **`RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`**.
- Recursion shines when dealing with hierarchical, self-similar data structures like nested trees and file systems.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What are the two mandatory components of every well-formed recursive function?
A. A while loop and a for loop
B. A base case and a recursive step
C. A lambda expression and a docstring
D. Positional arguments and keyword arguments

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Every recursive function must have a base case (halting condition that stops recursion) and a recursive step (which reduces the problem and calls the function with smaller inputs).

---

### 2. What error is raised by Python if a recursive function fails to hit a base case and calls itself indefinitely?
A. `MemoryOverflowException`
B. `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`
C. `SystemStackFault`
D. `ZeroDivisionError`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Python monitors stack depth and raises a `RecursionError` once the stack depth surpasses `sys.getrecursionlimit()` (default 1,000 frames) to protect against memory corruption.

---

### 3. What is the output of `mystery(3)` given the following function definition?
```python
def mystery(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n + mystery(n - 1)
```
A. 6
B. 3
C. 5
D. 1

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Trace execution: `mystery(3) = 3 + mystery(2)`. `mystery(2) = 2 + mystery(1)`. `mystery(1)` hits the base case and returns 1. Unwinding: `2 + 1 = 3`, then `3 + 3 = 6`.

---

### 4. What happens during the "unwinding" phase of a recursive function call stack?
A. Python allocates new stack memory for child threads
B. Base case values are returned and stack frames are popped in reverse order as calculations resolve
C. Python resets all local variables to zero
D. The compiler optimizes bytecode into C machine code

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In the unwinding phase, having reached the base case, each suspended stack frame completes its calculation with the child's return value, pops off the stack, and hands its result up to its caller.

---

### 5. Why is a loop often preferred over recursion for simple linear iterations in Python?
A. Loops can handle floating-point numbers, while recursion cannot
B. Python does not support Tail Call Optimization (TCO), meaning every recursive call allocates a new stack frame in $O(N)$ memory
C. Recursion is prohibited by PEP 8
D. Python limits functions to 5 total invocations

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Python does not optimize tail-recursive calls into loops. Every recursive call consumes stack frame memory ($O(N)$), whereas a loop runs in $O(1)$ constant auxiliary memory.

# Practice Challenge: Recursive Nested File Directory Size Calculator

Build an automated storage audit engine for a corporate cloud drive (Google Drive / Nextcloud).

Filesystems are inherently hierarchical: folders contain files as well as nested sub-folders, which in turn contain more files and folders. 

Write a recursive function:
`calculate_directory_size_bytes(directory_node)`

### Input Data Structure:
Each folder node is represented as a dictionary:
```python
{
    "name": "Folder Name",
    "type": "directory",
    "files": [
        {"name": "file1.pdf", "size_kb": 250},
        {"name": "file2.png", "size_kb": 1200}
    ],
    "subdirectories": [
        # ... more directory dictionaries ...
    ]
}
```

### Requirements:
1. Base Case: If `subdirectories` is empty, simply return the sum of the sizes of all files in the current folder.
2. Recursive Step: Sum the file sizes in the current folder, and recursively invoke `calculate_directory_size_bytes()` for every nested folder in `subdirectories`.
3. Render a hierarchical storage report showing cumulative Megabytes (MB).

### Complete Solution

```python

def calculate_directory_size_kb(node: dict, indent_level: int = 0) -> float:
    """Recursively calculates cumulative storage size of a directory tree."""
    indent = "  " * indent_level
    dir_name = node["name"]
    
    # 1. Sum direct local files in this folder
    local_files_kb = sum(f["size_kb"] for f in node.get("files", []))
    print(f"{indent}+-- [{dir_name}] (Direct Files: {len(node.get('files', []))} items | {local_files_kb:,.1f} KB)")
    
    # 2. Base Case & Recursive Step: Traverse subdirectories
    subdirs_total_kb = 0.0
    for subdir in node.get("subdirectories", []):
        # Recursive Call to child folder node
        subdirs_total_kb += calculate_directory_size_kb(subdir, indent_level + 1)
        
    cumulative_kb = local_files_kb + subdirs_total_kb
    return cumulative_kb
