# Opening & Closing Files in Python: Access Modes & Resource Management

Variables, dictionaries, and lists created in Python live in **RAM (Random Access Memory)**. RAM is volatile: as soon as your script finishes executing, the operating system reclaims the memory and all data vanishes.

To preserve data permanently across restarts, software systems rely on **file handling (File I/O)** to read from and write to non-volatile storage (SSDs or hard drives). In Python, working with files follows a three-step lifecycle:
1. **Open the file:** The operating system allocates a file descriptor and sets up a read/write buffer.
2. **Perform I/O:** Read content into variables or write new data to the file stream.
3. **Close the file:** Flush pending buffered data to physical disk and release the operating system lock.

|                      FILE HANDLING REAL-WORLD ANALOGIES                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. THE STATE BANK STRONGROOM LEDGER:
     - Step 1: The bank manager retrieves the physical loan ledger from the
       vault (`open`).
     - Step 2: An accountant records a new mortgage payment on the page (`write`).
     - Step 3: The manager returns the book to the vault, locks the steel
       door, and pockets the brass key (`close`).
     - If the ledger is left open on the counter:
       * Another branch clerk cannot access it (File Locking).
       * Wind or tea spills could corrupt the records (Data Corruption).
       * Unfinished penciled entries are never officially stamped (Unflushed Buffer).

  2. THE GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL PATIENT FOLDER:
     - Read Mode (`'r'`): Doctor opens folder to read previous blood reports.
     - Append Mode (`'a'`): Doctor attaches today's prescription to the back.
     - Write Mode (`'w'`): Hospital replaces the old folder entirely with a blank one!

## 1. The `open()` Function & Access Modes

Files in Python are opened using the built-in `open()` function:

```python
file_object = open(file_path, mode="r", encoding="utf-8")
```

### Comprehensive File Access Modes Matrix:

| Mode | Name | Behavior | Creates File If Missing? | Overwrites Existing? |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **`'r'`** | **Read (Default)** | Opens for reading. Pointer at the **beginning**. | **NO** (Raises `FileNotFoundError`) | No |
| **`'w'`** | **Write** | Opens for writing. **Truncates (erases)** entire file! | **YES** | **YES (Overwrites completely!)** |
| **`'a'`** | **Append** | Opens for writing. Pointer at the **end**. Preserves old data. | **YES** | **NO (Appends to end)** |
| **`'x'`** | **Exclusive Create**| Creates a brand new file for writing. | **YES** | **NO** (Raises `FileExistsError` if file exists) |
| **`'r+'`**| **Read + Write** | Opens for both reading and writing. | **NO** | No (Overwrites characters at pointer) |
| **`'b'`** | **Binary Mode** | Raw byte stream for images, PDFs, MP3s (e.g. `'rb'`, `'wb'`). | Mode dependent | Mode dependent |
| **`'t'`** | **Text Mode (Default)** | Decodes bytes to strings using character encodings (UTF-8). | Mode dependent | Mode dependent |

---

## 2. Practical File Operations: Write, Read, and Append

### Writing to a File (`'w'` Mode):
`'w'` mode overwrites everything currently in the file. If the file does not exist, Python creates it automatically:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Writing to a New File
# ==========================================================

# Open file for writing
log_file = open("station_schedule.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")

log_file.write("=== NEW DELHI RAILWAY STATION (NDLS) DAILY LOG ===\n")
log_file.write("Train #12004: Vande Bharat Express -> Departed 06:00 AM\n")
log_file.write("Train #12424: Rajdhani Express       -> Departed 16:15 PM\n")

# CRITICAL: Always close the file!
log_file.close()

print("File written and closed successfully.")
```

---

### Appending Data to an Existing File (`'a'` Mode):
`'a'` mode places the file pointer at the very end of the file, allowing you to add new lines without destroying existing records:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Appending Records Without Overwriting
# ==========================================================

log_file = open("station_schedule.txt", "a", encoding="utf-8")

# Appends new lines to the bottom of the file
log_file.write("Train #12260: Sealdah Duronto       -> Departed 19:45 PM\n")
log_file.close()

print("New train departure record appended successfully.")
```

---

### Reading the File Back (`'r'` Mode):
```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Reading File Contents
# ==========================================================

read_file = open("station_schedule.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
content = read_file.read()
read_file.close()

print("=== FILE CONTENTS READ FROM DISK ===")
print(content)
```

**Output:**
```text
=== FILE CONTENTS READ FROM DISK ===
=== NEW DELHI RAILWAY STATION (NDLS) DAILY LOG ===
Train #12004: Vande Bharat Express -> Departed 06:00 AM
Train #12424: Rajdhani Express       -> Departed 16:15 PM
Train #12260: Sealdah Duronto       -> Departed 19:45 PM
```

---

## 3. Why Must You Always Close Files (`file.close()`)?

1. **Flushing the Output Buffer:** Python does not immediately write every single character to disk. To maximize performance, it accumulates writes in a memory buffer. Closing the file forces Python to **flush** the buffer to physical disk.
2. **Releasing System File Handles:** Operating systems enforce limits on the maximum number of simultaneously open files (e.g. 1024 or 4096). Leaving files unclosed causes **file handle leaks**, eventually crashing servers.
3. **Windows File Locks:** On Microsoft Windows, an unclosed file remains locked by Python, preventing other programs from opening, moving, or deleting it.

---

## 4. Exclusive File Creation (`'x'` Mode)

When generating invoices or transaction tokens, you want to guarantee that you do not accidentally overwrite an existing customer's file. The `'x'` mode guarantees safety:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 4: Safe Creation with 'x' Mode
# ==========================================================

invoice_filename = "INVOICE_2026_001.txt"

try:
    inv = open(invoice_filename, "x", encoding="utf-8")
    inv.write("Invoice #001: Customer Amit Patel - Rs 4500.00\n")
    inv.close()
    print(f"Created new unique invoice file: {invoice_filename}")
except FileExistsError:
    print(f"[SECURITY ALERT] File '{invoice_filename}' already exists! Aborting overwrite.")
```

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts Best Practices

| Best Practice (DO) | Dangerous Anti-Pattern (DON'T) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO** specify `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly to prevent cross-platform text corruption. | **DON'T** use `'w'` mode when you intend to add records to an existing file; `'w'` erases past content! |
| **DO** call `file.close()` as soon as your I/O operations finish. | **DON'T** leave files open inside long-running loops or server endpoints. |
| **DO** use `'x'` mode when creating files that must never overwrite existing data. | **DON'T** assume written data is physically saved before closing or calling `flush()`. |

---

## Quick Revision Summary

- Python's built-in **`open(filename, mode)`** connects your script to a physical file on disk.
- **`'r'`** reads an existing file (errors if not found); **`'w'`** overwrites an existing file or creates a new one.
- **`'a'`** appends new data to the end of a file without destroying existing contents.
- **`'x'`** exclusively creates a new file, raising `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.
- Files must be closed with **`file.close()`** to flush buffered data to disk and release operating system file locks.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Which file mode will completely overwrite and erase the existing contents of a file when opened?
A. `'r'`
B. `'a'`
C. `'w'`
D. `'x'`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Opening a file in write mode (`'w'`) truncates the file length to 0 bytes, completely overwriting and wiping any prior data.

---

### 2. What happens if you attempt to open a non-existent file in read mode: `open("missing.txt", "r")`?
A. Python creates an empty file named "missing.txt"
B. Python raises a `FileNotFoundError`
C. Python returns `None`
D. The script pauses until the file is manually created

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Read mode (`'r'`) requires the file to exist on disk. If the specified file cannot be located, Python raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

---

### 3. What is the key advantage of using `'x'` mode (exclusive creation) over `'w'` mode?
A. `'x'` mode encrypts the file on disk
B. `'x'` mode raises a `FileExistsError` if the file already exists, protecting against accidental data overwrites
C. `'x'` mode runs 50% faster than `'w'`
D. `'x'` mode is required for binary images

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Exclusive creation mode (`'x'`) guarantees that a file is only created if it does not already exist. If a file with that name is present, Python prevents overwriting by raising a `FileExistsError`.

---

### 4. Why might data written with `file.write()` not immediately appear in the file on disk before `file.close()` is called?
A. Python encrypts all files before writing
B. Written data is held in an internal memory buffer in RAM and is only flushed to disk upon close or explicit flush
C. The operating system only writes files at midnight
D. `file.write()` is an asynchronous non-blocking thread

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** For I/O performance efficiency, Python buffers writes in RAM. The buffer is automatically flushed and committed to physical disk when `file.close()` or `file.flush()` executes.

---

### 5. What file access mode should be used to append new log entries to the end of an existing `server.log` file without losing past entries?
A. `'r+'`
B. `'w'`
C. `'a'`
D. `'x'`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Append mode (`'a'`) positions the write pointer at the end of the file, adding new content without altering or truncating existing records.

# Practice Challenge: Indian Railways Station Daily Dispatch Log Manager

Build an automated railway departure logging engine for the Station Master at Varanasi Junction (BSB).

### Requirements:
1. Write a function `initialize_station_log(filename)`:
   - Uses `'w'` mode to create a clean daily log header with Station Code, Date, and Column Titles (`"Train No | Name | Destination | Dep Time"`).
   - Properly closes the file.
2. Write a function `log_train_departure(filename, train_no, train_name, destination, dep_time)`:
   - Uses `'a'` mode to append an individual train departure entry to the log file.
   - Formats the entry using clean f-strings.
   - Properly closes the file.
3. Write a function `display_daily_station_manifest(filename)`:
   - Uses `'r'` mode to read the complete log from disk and display it to the console.
   - Properly closes the file.
4. Execute test dispatches for 3 express trains.
