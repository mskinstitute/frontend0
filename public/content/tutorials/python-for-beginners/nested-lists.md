# Nested Lists in Python: Multi-Dimensional Matrices, Coordinate Indexing & Deep Copying

In software development, real-world data is rarely flat. Digital spreadsheets, chessboard layouts, image pixel buffers, geometric grids, and restaurant seating plans naturally require multidimensional representations.

In Python, a **nested list** is simply a list that contains other lists as its individual elements. By combining nested lists with multi-index notation `matrix[row][col]`, you can build 2D matrices, 3D cubes, and hierarchically organized data trees.

## Real-World Analogy: The School Classroom Seating Chart & The Tic-Tac-Toe Grid

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                   NESTED LISTS REAL-WORLD ANALOGY                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. THE CLASSROOM BENCH GRID (Row & Column Coordinates):
     - Think of a high school classroom in Pune with 3 rows of benches.
     - Row 0 has 3 students: ["Aarav", "Bhavya", "Chirag"]
     - Row 1 has 3 students: ["Divya", "Esha",   "Farhan"]
     - Row 2 has 3 students: ["Gaurav", "Heena", "Ishaan"]
     - To call the student in Row 1 at Bench 2:
       classroom[1][2] -> "Farhan" (Row 1, Seat 2).

  2. THE TIC-TAC-TOE BOARD (Zero-Kaata Game):
     - A 3x3 board is modeled as 3 nested lists of 3 characters:
       board = [
           ["X", "O", "X"],
           ["O", "X", " "],
           [" ", "O", "O"]
       ]
     - Center square is board[1][1].

  3. THE APARTMENT MIRROR TRAP (Shallow List Multiplication):
     - If a builder uses magical cloning mirrors to build 3 floors from a single
       blueprint: [[0] * 3] * 3, any sofa placed on Floor 0 magically appears on
       Floor 1 and Floor 2! All 3 rows point to the exact same memory address!

## Visual Architecture: 2D Matrix Memory Model

```
===========================================================================
                 2D MATRIX COORDINATE SYSTEM IN MEMORY
===========================================================================

  matrix = [
      [10, 20, 30],   # Row 0
      [40, 50, 60],   # Row 1
      [70, 80, 90]    # Row 2
  ]

  Coordinate Map:
                    Col 0      Col 1      Col 2
                 +----------+----------+----------+
    Row 0 [0]    |  [0][0]  |  [0][1]  |  [0][2]  |
                 |    10    |    20    |    30    |
                 +----------+----------+----------+
    Row 1 [1]    |  [1][0]  |  [1][1]  |  [1][2]  |
                 |    40    |    50    |    60    |
                 +----------+----------+----------+
    Row 2 [2]    |  [2][0]  |  [2][1]  |  [2][2]  |
                 |    70    |    80    |    90    |
                 +----------+----------+----------+

  Access Path for 80: matrix[2][1]
  - Step 1: matrix[2] extracts Row 2: [70, 80, 90]
  - Step 2: [1] extracts Column 1 from that row: 80
```

## 1. Creating and Accessing 2D Lists

Accessing nested elements uses consecutive bracket pairs: the first bracket specifies the outer row index, and subsequent brackets drill down into deeper sub-lists:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: 2D Matrix Creation and Coordinate Access
# ==========================================================

# Tic-Tac-Toe game board (3x3 grid)
tic_tac_toe = [
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    ["O", "X", " "],
    [" ", "O", "X"]
]

# 1. Access an entire row
top_row = tic_tac_toe[0]
print(f"Top Row (Index 0): {top_row}")

# 2. Access individual coordinate [row][col]
center_cell = tic_tac_toe[1][1]
bottom_left = tic_tac_toe[2][0]
print(f"Center Cell [1][1]:      '{center_cell}'")
print(f"Bottom-Left Cell [2][0]: '{bottom_left}'")

# 3. In-place modification of a specific cell
tic_tac_toe[1][2] = "O"  # Player O marks empty square
print("\nUpdated Board State:")
for row in tic_tac_toe:
    print(" | ".join(row))
```

```text
Output:
Top Row (Index 0): ['X', 'O', 'X']
Center Cell [1][1]:      'X'
Bottom-Left Cell [2][0]: ' '

Updated Board State:
X | O | X
O | X | O
  | O | X
```

## 2. The Dangerous List Multiplication Trap: `[[0] * 3] * 3`

One of the most insidious bugs in Python occurs when initializing a 2D matrix using the multiplication operator `*` on an outer list:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: The Multiplication Bug vs Comprehension Fix
# ==========================================================

# THE BUG: Creating rows via outer multiplication
buggy_grid = [[0] * 3] * 3

print(f"Initial buggy grid: {buggy_grid}")
# Modify top-left cell ONLY:
buggy_grid[0][0] = 99
print(f"After modifying [0][0]: {buggy_grid}")
print("DISASTER! All 3 rows were modified because they share the identical memory pointer!\n")

# THE CORRECT FIX: List comprehension creates fresh, independent rows
safe_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
print(f"Initial safe grid:  {safe_grid}")
safe_grid[0][0] = 99
print(f"After modifying [0][0]: {safe_grid}")
print("SUCCESS! Only cell [0][0] changed because each row is an independent object.")
```

```text
Output:
Initial buggy grid: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
After modifying [0][0]: [[99, 0, 0], [99, 0, 0], [99, 0, 0]]
DISASTER! All 3 rows were modified because they share the identical memory pointer!

Initial safe grid:  [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
After modifying [0][0]: [[99, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
SUCCESS! Only cell [0][0] changed because each row is an independent object.
```

## 3. Deep Copying: `copy.deepcopy()`

A shallow copy (`my_list.copy()` or `my_list[:]`) only duplicates the outer container. Any nested sub-lists inside remain shared references! To fully clone a nested structure, you must use `copy.deepcopy()`:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy
# ==========================================================

import copy

original_matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# 1. Shallow copy
shallow = original_matrix.copy()
shallow[0][0] = 888
print(f"Original after shallow mutation: {original_matrix} (Corrupted!)")

# 2. Deep copy
deep = copy.deepcopy(original_matrix)
deep[0][0] = 111
print(f"Original after deep mutation:    {original_matrix} (Protected!)")
print(f"Deep copy modified:             {deep}")
```

```text
Output:
Original after shallow mutation: [[888, 2], [3, 4]] (Corrupted!)
Original after deep mutation:    [[888, 2], [3, 4]] (Protected!)
Deep copy modified:             [[111, 2], [3, 4]]
```

## 4. Traversing and Flattening Nested Lists

To process or convert a 2D matrix into a 1D flat list:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 4: Iterating and Flattening
# ==========================================================

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# 1. Nested for loops (Row by column iteration)
total_sum = 0
for row in matrix:
    for val in row:
        total_sum += val
print(f"Total matrix sum: {total_sum}")

# 2. Flattening into a 1D list via List Comprehension
flat_list = [val for row in matrix for val in row]
print(f"Flattened 1D list: {flat_list}")
```

```text
Output:
Total matrix sum: 45
Flattened 1D list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Do's and Don'ts: Nested Lists

| Scenario | ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Pythonic Idiom |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2D Matrix Init** | `[[0] * cols] * rows` (Shared reference bug) | `[[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]` |
| **Cloning Nested Lists** | `clone = matrix.copy()` (Leaves rows shared) | `import copy; clone = copy.deepcopy(matrix)` |
| **Flattening 2D Matrix** | Writing manual append loops | `[item for sub in matrix for item in sub]` |
| **Cell Coordinate Access** | `matrix[row, col]` (Raises TypeError in vanilla list) | `matrix[row][col]` |
| **Iterate Coordinates** | `for i in range(len(m)): for j in range(len(m[0])):` | `for row in matrix: for item in row:` |

## Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Given `grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, what does `grid[1][2]` evaluate to?
A. 4
B. 5
C. 6
D. 8

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `grid[1]` accesses the second row `[4, 5, 6]`. `[2]` accesses the third element within that row, which is `6`.

---

### 2. Why is `board = [[0] * 3] * 3` considered an anti-pattern in Python?
A. It raises a `MemoryError`
B. The outer `* 3` creates three references to the exact same row list in memory, so modifying one cell mutates all three rows
C. It only creates a 1D list of length 9
D. It causes a syntax error

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The multiplication operator duplicates object references. The outer multiplication replicates the reference to the single inner list `[0, 0, 0]` three times. Changing `board[0][0]` mutates that shared object, reflecting across all three rows.

---

### 3. Which module provides the `deepcopy()` function to duplicate nested lists independently?
A. `sys`
B. `os`
C. `copy`
D. `collections`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The standard library `copy` module provides `copy.deepcopy()`, which recursively duplicates all nested objects, lists, and references.

---

### 4. What is the output of the following list comprehension?
```python
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
flat = [x for row in matrix for x in row]
print(flat)
```
A. `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
B. `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
C. `[1, 3, 2, 4]`
D. `[[1, 3], [2, 4]]`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The nested comprehension iterates over each `row` in `matrix` and then each `x` in `row`, appending them into a single flat list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

---

### 5. What error occurs if you attempt to access an element using `matrix[1, 2]` on a standard Python list?
A. `IndexError`
B. `KeyError`
C. `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple`
D. `ValueError`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** In Python, comma-separated indices `[1, 2]` form a tuple `(1, 2)`. Standard Python lists do not accept tuples as indices (unlike NumPy arrays) and raise `TypeError`. Correct syntax is `matrix[1][2]`.

## Hands-On Practice Challenge: Cinema Hall Ticket Booking Matrix

Design a ticket reservation engine for a cinema hall in Bengaluru. The theater has 4 rows of 5 seats each (initialized as `O` for Open). Implement functions to display the seating chart, book a specific seat (`matrix[r][c] = "X"`), check if a seat is available, calculate total booked seats, and export a list of all reserved seat labels (e.g. `Row 2 Seat 3`).

### Starter Script & Complete Solution

        print(f"Row {r_idx}:  {row_str}")
    print("   ===========================================\n")

def book_seat(chart: list, row: int, col: int) -> bool:
    if 0 <= row < ROWS and 0 <= col < COLS:

            return False
    else:
        print(f"[ERROR] Invalid seat coordinate [{row}, {col}]!")
        return False

# Execute Bookings
