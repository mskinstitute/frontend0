# Loops with Else in Python: The `for-else` & `while-else` Architecture

One of Python's most unique—and frequently misunderstood—syntactic features is the ability to attach an **`else` clause** directly to a `for` or `while` loop. 

In everyday `if-else` conditionals, `else` signifies *"if the condition is False, do this instead."* However, when attached to a loop, `else` takes on a different, highly specialized meaning: **the `else` block executes ONLY IF the loop finished naturally without being interrupted by a `break` statement.**

## Real-World Analogy: The Lost Passport Search & Police Search Warrant

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    LOOP-ELSE REAL-WORLD ANALOGIES                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. SEARCHING FOR YOUR PASSPORT BEFORE AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT:
     - You search through 5 storage drawers in your study:
       drawers = ["Desk Drawer", "Closet Shelf", "Briefcase", "Locker Safe"]
     - FOR each drawer IN drawers:
       * If passport is inside:
           Take passport, breathe sigh of relief, and BREAK out of search!
     - ELSE (You searched every single drawer and NEVER hit 'break'):
       * File an emergency police FIR report for a lost passport.

  2. BANK ATM 3-ATTEMPT CARD VERIFICATION:
     - WHILE attempts < 3:
       * If PIN is correct: Authenticate customer and BREAK!
     - ELSE (Loop exhausted all 3 attempts without a successful break):
       * Confiscate card and trigger 24-hour security lockdown.
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

> [!NOTE]
> **A Helpful Mental Model:** Renowned Python core developer Raymond Hettinger suggests thinking of the loop `else` clause as **`no-break`**. It translates to: *"Run this loop, and if you did NOT break out of it, execute this finishing block."*

## 1. Replacing the "Boolean Flag Anti-Pattern"

In languages lacking loop `else`, programmers must create awkward temporary boolean flags (like `found = False`) to detect whether a search succeeded:

### The Clunky Boolean Flag Way:
```python
# C / Java style with cumbersome flag variable
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 7
found = False

for n in numbers:
    if n == target:
        found = True
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        break

if not found:
    print(f"Target {target} was NOT found in the list.")
```

### The Clean, Pythonic `for-else` Way:
With Python's `for-else`, the flag variable is completely eliminated:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Elegant Pythonic Search with for-else
# ==========================================================

numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 7

for n in numbers:
    if n == target:
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        break
else:
    # Runs ONLY if the loop completed without hitting 'break'
    print(f"Target {target} was NOT found in the list.")
```

**Output:**
```text
Target 7 was NOT found in the list.
```

---

## 2. Classic Computer Science Example: Prime Number Testing

A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. To test whether a number is prime, test all possible divisors from 2 up to $\sqrt{N}$. If any divisor divides evenly, the number is composite (`break`). If no divisor divides evenly, the loop exhausts naturally and enters the `else` block:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Prime Number Detector via for-else
# ==========================================================

candidate_numbers = [29, 35, 47, 51]

for num in candidate_numbers:
    # Test divisors from 2 up to integer square root
    limit = int(num ** 0.5) + 1
    
    for divisor in range(2, limit):
        if num % divisor == 0:
            print(f"[COMPOSITE] {num} is not prime (divisible by {divisor}).")
            break  # Exits inner loop; skips else block
    else:
        # Runs ONLY if no divisor divided num
        print(f"[PRIME]     {num} is a PRIME number!")
```

**Output:**
```text
[PRIME]     29 is a PRIME number!
[COMPOSITE] 35 is not prime (divisible by 5).
[PRIME]     47 is a PRIME number!
[COMPOSITE] 51 is not prime (divisible by 3).
```

---

## 3. The `while-else` Construct: Network Retry Protocol

The `while-else` construct operates on identical principles. If the while loop condition becomes `False` without encountering a `break`, the `else` block executes:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Resilient Network Connection Retry Loop
# ==========================================================

max_retries = 3
attempt = 0
server_online = False  # Simulated server outage

print("=== CONNECTING TO RBI NEFT SETTLEMENT GATEWAY ===")

while attempt < max_retries:
    attempt += 1
    print(f"Attempt #{attempt}: Pinging server...")
    
    if server_online:
        print("--> [SUCCESS] Connection established! Commencing financial sync.")
        break  # Bypasses the else block!
else:
    # Runs if all attempts failed without a break
    print("\n--> [FATAL FAILURE] All retry attempts exhausted. Routing to backup disaster recovery node.")
```

**Output:**
```text
=== CONNECTING TO RBI NEFT SETTLEMENT GATEWAY ===
Attempt #1: Pinging server...
Attempt #2: Pinging server...
Attempt #3: Pinging server...

--> [FATAL FAILURE] All retry attempts exhausted. Routing to backup disaster recovery node.
```

## 4. Behavior When Iterating Over an Empty Sequence

What happens if a `for` loop runs on an empty list?

```python
empty_list = []
for item in empty_list:
    print("This will never print")
    break
else:
    print("Loop finished immediately: Else block executed!")
```

**Output:**
```text
Loop finished immediately: Else block executed!
```

Because the loop never encountered a `break` statement (the loop body was never entered), the `else` block executes immediately.

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts Best Practices

| Best Practice (DO) | Dangerous Anti-Pattern (DON'T) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO** use `for-else` for search-and-confirm algorithms (linear scan, prime check, validation). | **DON'T** use loop `else` unless there is at least one conditional `break` statement inside the loop. Without `break`, `else` always runs, making it pointless. |
| **DO** comment your loop else: `# no-break: item not found` to help junior developers who may be unfamiliar with the syntax. | **DON'T** confuse loop `else` with an `if-else` block; make sure the `else` aligns with `for` or `while`, not an inner `if`. |
| **DO** use `while-else` for bounded retry loops and exhaustion handlers. | **DON'T** write deeply nested multi-level loops all with their own `else` blocks; it quickly hurts readability. |

---

## Quick Revision Summary

- Python's `for-else` and `while-else` execute the `else` block **only if** the loop completed without encountering a `break`.
- If a `break` statement terminates the loop, the `else` block is **skipped entirely**.
- If a loop finishes naturally through sequence exhaustion or its condition becomes `False`, the `else` block runs.
- If iterating over an empty collection, the loop body doesn't run, but the `else` block **does execute** (because no `break` was encountered).
- Loop-else eliminates the need for temporary boolean flag variables (`found = False`).

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. When does the `else` block of a Python `for` or `while` loop execute?
A. Whenever an exception occurs inside the loop
B. On every single iteration of the loop
C. Only when the loop finishes all iterations naturally without hitting a `break` statement
D. Only when the loop condition is initially `False`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The `else` clause of a loop executes if and only if the loop terminates normally without being aborted by an explicit `break` statement.

---

### 2. What will be printed by the following code?
```python
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    if x == 2:
        break
else:
    print("Finished")
```
A. Finished
B. 1 2 Finished
C. 2
D. Nothing is printed

**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** In the second iteration, `x == 2` evaluates to `True`, triggering the `break` statement. When `break` executes, the loop terminates immediately and the `else` block is completely skipped. Thus, nothing is printed.

---

### 3. What will be printed by the following code?
```python
for x in [10, 20, 30]:
    if x == 99:
        break
else:
    print("Target Missing")
```
A. Target Missing
B. 10 20 30
C. SyntaxError
D. Nothing is printed

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The value 99 is not present in the list, so `x == 99` is never `True`, and `break` is never encountered. The loop completes all iterations, triggering the `else` block which prints `"Target Missing"`.

---

### 4. What happens if a `for-else` loop iterates over an empty list `[]`?
A. Python raises an `IndexError`
B. The loop body does not run, but the `else` block executes immediately
C. The loop body executes once with `None`
D. Neither the loop body nor the `else` block executes

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When iterating over an empty list, the loop terminates immediately without ever hitting a `break`. Because no `break` occurred, the `else` block executes.

---

### 5. Why is using `for-else` considered superior to maintaining a boolean flag variable like `is_found = False`?
A. It saves 64 bits of stack memory per function call
B. It eliminates boilerplate code, avoids variable declaration clutter, and makes the search-and-fallback intent explicit
C. It allows loops to run asynchronously on multiple CPU threads
D. Boolean flags are deprecated in Python 3.12

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Python's `for-else` structure directly expresses the search pattern: attempt to find an item and break; if exhausted without breaking, take fallback action. It removes redundant variable tracking and reduces bug surface area.

# Practice Challenge: Airline Passenger Manifest Verification & Upgrade Engine

Build an automated boarding and seat reservation verification engine for Air India flight AI-102 (New Delhi to London Heathrow). 

The ground dispatch crew needs to verify passenger manifests:
1. Search a list of checked-in passenger records for a specific high-value customer (by Passport Number).
2. If the passenger is located in Economy class:
   - Check if an upgrade to Business Class is available (`business_seats_open > 0`).
   - If yes, upgrade the passenger, decrement available seats, print an upgrade confirmation, and **`break`**.
   - If no business seats remain, confirm their existing Economy seat and **`break`**.
3. If the entire passenger manifest is scanned and the passport number is **never found**, the **`else`** block must trigger an alert: dispatch a security gate notice that the passenger has not yet reported to the gate.
