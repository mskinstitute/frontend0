# Working with open() & Context Managers

In professional software development, manually calling `f.close()` after opening a file is considered an anti-pattern. If your program encounters a runtime error, a zero division bug, or an unexpected exception between `f = open(...)` and `f.close()`, the file remains trapped in operating system memory.

Python solves this with the `with` statement—powered by **Context Managers**. The `with open(...) as f:` construct guarantees that files are cleanly and immediately closed the moment execution leaves the code block, even if catastrophic exceptions occur.

## The Real-World Analogy: Automated Bank Vault Airlock

Imagine entering the high-security safe deposit locker vault at the State Bank of India:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|               AUTOMATED METRO / VAULT AIRLOCK SYSTEM              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   |
|   1. Entry: Customer scans biometrics / keycard                   |
|      ==> __enter__() triggers: Heavy vault door opens             |
|                                                                   |
|   2. Inside: Customer deposits gold / inspects deeds              |
|      ==> User code executes inside the 'with' block               |
|                                                                   |
|   3. Exit: Customer walks out OR medical alarm triggers           |
|      ==> __exit__() triggers: Vault door automatically shuts &    |
|          pneumatic deadbolts lock down regardless of what happened!|
|                                                                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Manual `open()` & `close()`:** Like leaving a bank locker door wide open, hoping the customer remembers to lock the padlock before leaving for lunch. If the customer faints or rushes away in an emergency, the locker remains exposed.
- **`with open(...) as f:`:** An automated security airlock. The door opens when you enter (`__enter__`), and the moment you step outside—or if the building alarm sounds (`Exception`)—the door slams shut and locks itself (`__exit__`).

---

## Why Manual `close()` Is Dangerous

When you open a file using `f = open('data.txt', 'w')`:
1. The operating system allocates a **File Descriptor** (an integer handle in the OS kernel table).
2. Data written via `f.write()` is not immediately flushed to the physical NVMe SSD or hard disk; it sits inside a fast RAM buffer.
3. If an error occurs before `f.close()`, the buffer is **never written to disk**, resulting in truncated or completely corrupted files.
4. If your program runs in a loop (like a web server or sensor monitor) and keeps opening files without closing them, the operating system throws:
   `OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files`

### Comparing Manual vs Context Manager Handling

```
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
|  Manual Handling (Error-Prone)     |  Context Manager (Industry Gold)   |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
|  f = open("khata.txt", "w")         |  with open("khata.txt", "w") as f: |
|  f.write("Aman: ₹450\n")           |      f.write("Aman: ₹450\n")       |
|  # What if a bug crashes here?     |      val = 100 / 0 # Crash!        |
|  val = 100 / 0  <-- Crash!         |  # Python AUTOMATICALLY calls      |
|  f.close()  <-- NEVER REACHED!     |  # f.close() even on ZeroDivision! |
|  (File leaked, data unwritten!)    |  (Data safely flushed to disk!)    |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

## How `with` Works: The Context Management Protocol

Behind the scenes, Python file objects implement two special dunder methods:

1. **`__enter__()`**:
   - Called immediately when entering the `with` block.
   - Prepares the resource (opens the file handle on the OS level).
   - Returns the file object, assigned to the variable after `as` (e.g., `f`).

2. **`__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`**:
   - Called automatically when execution exits the indented block.
   - Runs under **all** circumstances: normal completion, `return`, `break`, `continue`, or any uncaught `Exception`.
   - Flushes buffers and invokes `f.close()`.

---

## Comprehensive Code Examples

### 1. Basic Safe Reading & Writing

```python
# Safe writing using context manager
with open("kirana_ledger.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Order 101: 5 kg Basmati Rice - Rs 450\n")
    f.write("Order 102: 1 L Mustard Oil - Rs 180\n")
    f.write("Order 103: 2 kg Toor Dal - Rs 320\n")

print("File written successfully.")

# Safe reading
with open("kirana_ledger.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print("--- File Contents ---")
    print(content.strip())

# Verifying that the file is automatically closed outside the with block
print("Is file closed after exiting with block?", f.closed)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
File written successfully.
--- File Contents ---
Order 101: 5 kg Basmati Rice - Rs 450
Order 102: 1 L Mustard Oil - Rs 180
Order 103: 2 kg Toor Dal - Rs 320
Is file closed after exiting with block? True
```

---

### 2. Proving Automatic Cleanup During Exceptions

Let us prove that even if a crash occurs inside the `with` block, Python never leaks the file.

```python
file_ref = None

try:
    with open("crash_test.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        file_ref = f
        f.write("Critical bank transaction in progress...\n")
        print("Inside block: is file closed?", f.closed)
        
        # Simulate an unexpected runtime exception
        result = 5000 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError!
        f.write("This line will never execute.")

except ZeroDivisionError as err:
    print(f"Handled Exception: {err}")

# Inspecting file status after the crash
print("Outside block: is file closed?", file_ref.closed)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Inside block: is file closed? False
Handled Exception: division by zero
Outside block: is file closed? True
```

---

### 3. Managing Multiple Files Simultaneously

You can manage multiple files in a single `with` statement by separating them with commas. This is ideal for copying, transforming, or backing up data.

```python
source_file = "kirana_ledger.txt"
backup_file = "ledger_backup_2026.txt"

# Modern Python supports multiple file handles in one with statement
with open(source_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as src, open(backup_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as dst:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(src, start=1):
        # Prefix an audit timestamp and write to backup
        dst.write(f"[LOG {line_no:03d}] {line}")

print(f"Successfully cloned and audited {source_file} into {backup_file}.")

# Confirm both files are closed
print("Source closed?", src.closed)
print("Backup closed?", dst.closed)

# Verify backup content
with open(backup_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as review:
    print(review.read().strip())
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Successfully cloned and audited kirana_ledger.txt into ledger_backup_2026.txt.
Source closed? True
Backup closed? True
[LOG 001] Order 101: 5 kg Basmati Rice - Rs 450
[LOG 002] Order 102: 1 L Mustard Oil - Rs 180
[LOG 003] Order 103: 2 kg Toor Dal - Rs 320
```

### 4. Combining `try...except` with `with open`

The `with` statement guarantees cleanup, but if the file does not exist when opening in `'r'` mode, Python raises `FileNotFoundError` before entering the block. The standard production pattern pairs `try` with `with`:

```python
def safe_read_report(filepath):
    try:
        with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"[ERROR] File '{filepath}' not found on disk."
    except PermissionError:
        return f"[ERROR] Insufficient permissions to read '{filepath}'."

print(safe_read_report("kirana_ledger.txt"))
print(safe_read_report("missing_gst_filing.txt"))
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Order 101: 5 kg Basmati Rice - Rs 450
Order 102: 1 L Mustard Oil - Rs 180
Order 103: 2 kg Toor Dal - Rs 320

[ERROR] File 'missing_gst_filing.txt' not found on disk.
```

## Best Practices & Comparison: Do's and Don'ts

| Practice | Bad / Risky Pattern | Gold-Standard Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Opening Files** | `f = open('data.txt', 'r')` | `with open('data.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:` |
| **Closing Files** | Calling `f.close()` manually at the end | Let `with` handle closure automatically |
| **Handling Crashes** | Writing fragile code hoping errors won't occur | Rely on `__exit__` cleanup + wrap in `try/except` |
| **Character Encoding** | Relying on system default encoding | Explicitly pass `encoding='utf-8'` |
| **Multiple Files** | Nested manual `open()` calls with complex `finally` | `with open('a.txt') as a, open('b.txt') as b:` |
| **Accessing After Block** | Reading `f.read()` outside the `with` block | Complete all I/O operations strictly inside the block |

## Quick Revision Summary Cheat Sheet

- **Syntax:** `with open("filename.ext", "mode", encoding="utf-8") as alias:`
- **Under the Hood:** Powered by `__enter__()` (allocates resource) and `__exit__()` (releases resource).
- **Safety Guarantee:** The file is guaranteed to close even if an unhandled exception, `return`, or `break` occurs.
- **Resource Protection:** Prevents file descriptor leaks (`OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files`) and Windows file-locking collisions.
- **Verification:** The boolean attribute `file_object.closed` returns `True` once the `with` block finishes.
- **Multi-File Context:** Use comma separation: `with open('file1.txt') as f1, open('file2.txt') as f2:`.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What is the primary architectural advantage of using the 'with open(...) as f:' context manager over manual open() and close()?
A. It compresses the file using gzip algorithm
B. It automatically and deterministically closes the file upon block exit, even if exceptions occur
C. It allows writing to read-only files without permission errors
D. It keeps the file permanently open in RAM for faster continuous reading
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The context manager protocol triggers the file object's `__exit__()` method automatically when execution leaves the indented block, guaranteeing resource release even in the presence of unhandled errors.

---

### 2. Which two dunder (special) methods define Python's Context Manager protocol?
A. `__init__` and `__del__`
B. `__start__` and `__stop__`
C. `__enter__` and `__exit__`
D. `__open__` and `__close__`
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Any Python object implementing `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` satisfies the Context Management protocol and can be utilized with the `with` statement.

---

### 3. What is the output of the following code snippet?
```python
with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Python")
print(f.closed)
```
A. False
B. True
C. None
D. AttributeError: 'file' object has no attribute 'closed'
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Outside the `with` block, Python has already invoked `f.close()`. Inspecting the `f.closed` boolean attribute returns `True`.

---

### 4. How can two files be safely opened simultaneously for reading and writing in a single with statement?
A. `with open("in.txt", "r") and open("out.txt", "w"):`
B. `with open("in.txt", "r") as src, open("out.txt", "w") as dst:`
C. `with (open("in.txt", "r") + open("out.txt", "w")) as (src, dst):`
D. `with open(["in.txt", "out.txt"], ["r", "w"]) as f:`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Python permits multiple context managers in a single `with` statement separated by commas: `with open(...) as src, open(...) as dst:`. Both files are guaranteed to be closed safely.

---

### 5. What occurs if an unhandled ZeroDivisionError happens inside a with open() block?
A. The file remains open and locked forever by the operating system
B. The operating system corrupts the entire hard drive
C. The `__exit__()` method executes, closes the file, and then the ZeroDivisionError propagates upward
D. Python swallows the error silently and keeps running
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Context managers do not suppress exceptions unless explicitly programmed to do so. Python calls `__exit__()` to flush and close the file, and then bubbles the exception up the call stack.

# Practice Challenge

### Scenario: Safe Kirana Store Daily Transaction Archiver

Write a Python script that:
1. Creates a sample daily transaction file `sales_today.txt` containing 4 customer transactions.
2. Uses a single `with` statement to open `sales_today.txt` for reading and `sales_archive.txt` for writing.
3. Iterates through the lines, adds a transaction sequence tag `[TXN-#]`, and writes each line into `sales_archive.txt`.
4. Validates that both file handles report `f.closed == True` outside the block.
5. Reads and displays the final archived file to confirm data integrity.

### Starter Code
```python
# Create test data
with open("sales_today.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Suresh: Milk 2L - Rs 120\n")
    f.write("Pooja: Atta 5kg - Rs 240\n")
    f.write("Vikram: Sugar 1kg - Rs 45\n")
    f.write("Ananya: Tea 500g - Rs 160\n")

# TODO: Use with open(...) as src, open(...) as dst to archive the transactions
```

### Complete Solution
```python
# Step 1: Create today's test transaction log
with open("sales_today.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Suresh: Milk 2L - Rs 120\n")
    f.write("Pooja: Atta 5kg - Rs 240\n")
    f.write("Vikram: Sugar 1kg - Rs 45\n")
    f.write("Ananya: Tea 500g - Rs 160\n")

# Step 2: Archive using dual context managers
with open("sales_today.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as src, open("sales_archive.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as dst:
    for idx, transaction in enumerate(src, start=101):
        formatted_entry = f"[TXN-{idx}] {transaction}"
        dst.write(formatted_entry)

# Step 3: Verify deterministic resource closure
print(f"Source file closed: {src.closed}")
print(f"Archive file closed: {dst.closed}")

# Step 4: Verify archive contents
print("\n--- Final Archived Ledger ---")
with open("sales_archive.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as archive:
    print(archive.read().strip())
```

### Expected Output
```text
Source file closed: True
Archive file closed: True

--- Final Archived Ledger ---
[TXN-101] Suresh: Milk 2L - Rs 120
[TXN-102] Pooja: Atta 5kg - Rs 240
[TXN-103] Vikram: Sugar 1kg - Rs 45
[TXN-104] Ananya: Tea 500g - Rs 160
```
