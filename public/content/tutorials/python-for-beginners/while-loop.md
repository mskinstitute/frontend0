# While Loops in Python: Condition-Controlled Iteration & State Invariants

In programming, repetition is fundamental. When you know in advance exactly how many times a code block must run (e.g. iterating over 50 student records), a `for` loop is ideal. However, when an action must repeat until an **unpredictable condition changes** (e.g. waiting for a user to enter the correct password, or streaming sensor data until a connection drops), Python provides the **`while` loop**.

A `while` loop is **condition-controlled**: it repeatedly evaluates a boolean expression and executes its indented block as long as that expression remains `True`.

|                      WHILE LOOP REAL-WORLD ANALOGIES                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. THE CHAI TAPRI STOVE BURNER:
     - The tea vendor places milk, water, tea leaves, and ginger on the stove.
     - State condition: Is the chai boiling?
       * WHILE chai_is_boiling == False:
           Keep gas burner ON, stir gently, check temperature.
       * Once boiling bubbles rise (chai_is_boiling == True):
           Exit loop, turn off gas knob, pour into kulhad glasses.
     - The vendor does not know the exact millisecond it will boil;
       they loop strictly based on the physical condition.

  2. STATE BANK OF INDIA (SBI) ATM PIN RETRY ENGINE:
     - An ATM customer inserts their debit card.
     - State condition: Attempts remaining > 0 and PIN unverified.
       * Attempt 1: Incorrect PIN -> attempts left = 2. Loop continues.
       * Attempt 2: Incorrect PIN -> attempts left = 1. Loop continues.
       * Attempt 3: Incorrect PIN -> attempts left = 0. Loop terminates!
     - The ATM blocks the debit card for 24 hours.

## 1. The Four Essential Pillars of a While Loop

To construct a predictable `while` loop that terminates cleanly, four components are mandatory:

1. **Initialization:** Setting up one or more control variables before the loop begins.
2. **Condition Test:** A boolean expression checked before *every* iteration.
3. **Loop Body:** The statements executed on each cycle.
4. **State Mutation (Update Step):** Modifying the control variable inside the body so the condition eventually evaluates to `False`.

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: The Four Pillars of a While Loop
# ==========================================================

# 1. Initialization
token_number = 1

# 2. Condition Test (Runs while token_number <= 4)
while token_number <= 4:
    # 3. Loop Body
    print(f"Token #{token_number}: Customer served at Cashier Counter 2.")
    
    # 4. State Mutation (Crucial update step)
    token_number += 1

print("All tokens for this batch have been cleared.")
```

**Output:**
```text
Token #1: Customer served at Cashier Counter 2.
Token #2: Customer served at Cashier Counter 2.
Token #3: Customer served at Cashier Counter 2.
Token #4: Customer served at Cashier Counter 2.
All tokens for this batch have been cleared.
```

## 2. The Danger of Infinite Loops

If the state mutation step is omitted, or if the condition can never logically evaluate to `False`, Python enters an **infinite loop**. The program locks up, consuming 100% of a CPU core until forcibly killed.

```python
# DANGEROUS BUG: Infinite Loop (counter never increments)
counter = 1
while counter <= 5:
    print(counter)
    # FORGOT: counter += 1  <-- Program will print 1 forever!
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Terminating an Infinite Loop:** If your terminal or console gets stuck executing an infinite loop, press **`Ctrl + C`** (or `Cmd + C` on macOS) to send a `KeyboardInterrupt` signal to kill the CPython interpreter process.

---

## 3. Intentional Infinite Loops (`while True:`)

Sometimes, an infinite loop is deliberately intended. Modern server daemons, microservices, game engines, and command-line interfaces run inside an infinite loop that continues until an explicit `break` condition or shutdown signal occurs:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Intentional Event Loop with Break Sentinel
# ==========================================================

import time

tick_count = 0
print("=== RADAR DISPATCH HEARTBEAT ACTIVATED ===")

while True:
    tick_count += 1
    print(f"[HEARTBEAT] Ping #{tick_count}: Telemetry nominal.")
    
    # Graceful exit condition
    if tick_count >= 3:
        print("[SHUTDOWN] Scheduled telemetry sample window complete.")
        break  # Forcibly exit loop
```

**Output:**
```text
=== RADAR DISPATCH HEARTBEAT ACTIVATED ===
[HEARTBEAT] Ping #1: Telemetry nominal.
[HEARTBEAT] Ping #2: Telemetry nominal.
[HEARTBEAT] Ping #3: Telemetry nominal.
[SHUTDOWN] Scheduled telemetry sample window complete.
```

## 4. Sentinel-Controlled Loops (Interactive Applications)

A **sentinel value** is a special input value (such as `"exit"`, `"quit"`, or `-1`) that signals the loop to terminate. This pattern is standard for menu-driven CLI tools and data entry programs:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Sentinel-Controlled Kirana Store Ledger
# ==========================================================

simulated_inputs = ["120.50", "45.00", "300.00", "done"]
input_index = 0

total_bill = 0.0
item_count = 0

print("=== SHARMA KIRANA STORE POS TERMINAL ===")
print("Enter item prices. Enter 'done' to compute final bill.\n")

while True:
    raw_input = simulated_inputs[input_index]
    input_index += 1
    
    if raw_input.lower() == "done":
        print("--> Checkout sentinel received.")
        break
        
    price = float(raw_input)
    total_bill += price
    item_count += 1
    print(f"Scanned Item #{item_count}: Rs {price:.2f} (Subtotal: Rs {total_bill:.2f})")

print("-" * 45)
print(f"Final Invoice: {item_count} Items | Total: Rs {total_bill:.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```text
=== SHARMA KIRANA STORE POS TERMINAL ===
Enter item prices. Enter 'done' to compute final bill.

Scanned Item #1: Rs 120.50 (Subtotal: Rs 120.50)
Scanned Item #2: Rs 45.00 (Subtotal: Rs 165.50)
Scanned Item #3: Rs 300.00 (Subtotal: Rs 465.50)
--> Checkout sentinel received.
---------------------------------------------
Final Invoice: 3 Items | Total: Rs 465.50
```

## 5. Do's and Don'ts Best Practices

| Best Practice (DO) | Dangerous Anti-Pattern (DON'T) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO** ensure the control variable advances toward the exit condition on *every* branch. | **DON'T** forget to increment counters inside loop bodies, leading to CPU-hanging infinite loops. |
| **DO** use `while` when the number of iterations depends on runtime input, events, or state. | **DON'T** use `while` to iterate over lists or ranges when a `for` loop is cleaner and safer. |
| **DO** include safety circuit-breakers (e.g. `max_iterations = 1000`) in critical production loops. | **DON'T** write complex conditional checks inside `while` that mutate multiple unrelated variables. |

---

## Quick Revision Summary

- A **`while` loop** repeats a block of code as long as its test condition remains `True`.
- The test condition is checked at the **start** of each iteration (pre-test loop). If the condition is initially `False`, the loop body never executes.
- Every `while` loop requires proper **initialization**, an **exit condition**, and a **state mutation** that eventually makes the condition `False`.
- Forgetting to mutate the control variable results in an **infinite loop**, which must be halted using `Ctrl + C`.
- The `while True:` idiom coupled with an internal `break` statement is the standard Python pattern for event loops and sentinel-controlled input processing.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What happens if the condition of a `while` loop is `False` upon first evaluation?
A. The loop runs exactly once
B. Python raises an `IndentationError`
C. The loop body is skipped entirely, and execution proceeds past the loop
D. Python hangs in an infinite loop

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Python's `while` loop is a pre-test loop. The condition is evaluated prior to entering the body. If it evaluates to `False` immediately, the loop body is bypassed completely.

---

### 2. What will be printed by the following code?
```python
i = 5
while i > 0:
    i -= 2
print(i)
```
A. 1
B. 0
C. -1
D. 3

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Trace the loop: Initially `i = 5`. Iteration 1: `5 > 0` is True, `i` becomes `5 - 2 = 3`. Iteration 2: `3 > 0` is True, `i` becomes `3 - 2 = 1`. Iteration 3: `1 > 0` is True, `i` becomes `1 - 2 = -1`. Iteration 4: `-1 > 0` is False, loop exits. Final `print(i)` outputs `-1`.

---

### 3. Which keyboard shortcut interrupts and kills an infinite loop running in a terminal?
A. Ctrl + Z
B. Ctrl + C
C. Ctrl + Shift + Esc
D. Alt + F4

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In command line and terminal environments, pressing `Ctrl + C` sends a `SIGINT` (Signal Interrupt) to Python, raising a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception that terminates the script.

---

### 4. What is a "sentinel value" in the context of while loops?
A. A variable that stores the memory address of the loop
B. A predefined dummy input value used to signal the end of loop iteration
C. An integer counter that increments by 2
D. A cryptographic hash guarding the loop body

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A sentinel value (such as `"exit"`, `"stop"`, or `-1`) is a distinctive signal entered by a user or data stream that indicates data entry has concluded, triggering loop termination.

---

### 5. Consider the following code snippet:
```python
x = 0
while x < 3:
    print(x, end=" ")
```
What behavior will be observed when running this code?
A. It outputs `0 1 2`
B. It outputs `0 1 2 3`
C. It produces an infinite loop printing `0` repeatedly
D. It raises a `NameError`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Because variable `x` is never modified or incremented inside the loop body, `x < 3` remains perpetually `True` (`0 < 3`). This results in an infinite loop printing `0 0 0 ...`.

# Practice Challenge: IRCTC Tatkal Waiting List Clearance Simulation

Simulate the automated charting and ticket confirmation process of the Indian Railways reservation system. 

When passengers cancel their confirmed tickets, passengers on the Waiting List (WL) are upgraded sequentially:
- A train starts with an initial waiting list queue (e.g. `current_wl = 5`).
- The ticket system receives cancellation notifications one by one.
- Use a `while` loop to simulate cancellations until either:
  1. All waiting list passengers are confirmed (`current_wl == 0`).
  2. The maximum cancellation quota is reached.

Track and print the status on each iteration, and log the final charting status.

    print(f"=== IRCTC CHARTING ENGINE: INITIAL WL {initial_wl} ===")
    
    # While loop: runs as long as waiting passengers exist AND cancellation events remain
    while wl_counter > 0 and event_idx < total_events:
        passenger_cancelled = cancellation_events[event_idx]
        event_idx += 1
