# Capstone Project: Interactive CLI Quiz Application

Interactive testing and automated assessment engines are among the most ubiquitous real-world software applications—from university entrance portals to edtech learning platforms.

In this capstone project, you will combine lists, dictionaries, functions, control loops, and file persistence to build an interactive, production-ready **CLI Quiz Application** equipped with score tracking, conceptual explanations, and a persistent top-score leaderboard.

## Real-World Analogy: The KBC Hotseat Engine

Imagine the computer system behind India's famous quiz show *Kaun Banega Crorepati* (KBC):

|                                                                         |

|                                   'leaderboard.txt' via with open(...)  |
|                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Every question is a structured dictionary, each response is sanitized against invalid inputs, and final scores are preserved on disk so winners are remembered across game sessions.

## Project Specification & Architecture

Our Quiz Application consists of 4 decoupled components:
1. **Question Bank:** A list of dictionaries containing questions, 4 structured choices, the correct answer key (`"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, or `"D"`), and a brief conceptual explanation.
2. **Game Engine:**
   - Shuffles questions to give each player a fresh randomized attempt.
   - Prompts the user with robust input validation.
   - Tracks correct answers, incorrect answers, and cumulative score.
3. **Assessment Reporter:**
   - Calculates score percentage, accuracy rating, and qualitative grade (e.g., *Distinction*, *Pass*, *Needs Improvement*).
4. **Leaderboard File Persistence:**
   - Appends player scores with timestamps to `quiz_leaderboard.txt`.
   - Reads and ranks top scores in descending order.

## Best Practices & Comparison: Do's and Don'ts

| Practice | Bad Implementation | Gold-Standard Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Question Storage** | Hardcoding `if question == 1:` cascades | Structured data structures (list of dictionaries) |
| **Input Validation** | Assuming input is always valid | Strict `while True` loop validating `'A'` through `'D'` |
| **Question Order** | Presenting static questions in identical order | Shuffle questions with `random.sample()` for fairness |
| **Leaderboard Sync** | Overwriting file on every play | Append mode (`"a"`) preserving historic competition data |
| **Feedback** | Only showing final score at the very end | Immediate question-by-question feedback and insights |
| **Score Sorting** | Printing entries in raw chronological order | Sort descending by score using `entries.sort(key=...)` |

---

## Quick Revision Summary Cheat Sheet

- **Data Modeling:** Model complex entities (quizzes, products, transactions) as lists of dictionaries for modular iteration.
- **Randomization:** Use `random.sample(seq, len(seq))` to create a non-destructive shuffled copy of a sequence.
- **Input Sanitization:** Combine `.strip().upper()` to gracefully accept `" a "`, `"A"`, or `"a"`.
- **Append Mode (`'a'`):** Ideal for logging events, audit trails, and leaderboard score archives without truncating prior history.
- **Custom Sorting:** Use `list.sort(key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)` to order multi-column tuples or dictionaries.

---

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What does random.sample(population, k) return when shuffling questions?
A. It deletes `k` items from the original list
B. It returns a new list of `k` unique elements chosen randomly without altering the original list
C. It reverses the list in place
D. It returns a single random integer
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `random.sample()` creates a new list containing `k` randomly selected items from the source population, leaving the original data structure untouched.

---

### 2. Why is file append mode ('a') chosen over write mode ('w') for the leaderboard?
A. Because 'w' mode deletes existing high scores upon opening, whereas 'a' preserves prior records and adds new scores to the end
B. Because 'a' compresses the file
C. Because 'w' mode can only write integers
D. Because 'a' mode requires administrative rights
**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Write mode (`'w'`) truncates the file to 0 bytes upon opening, destroying past entries. Append mode (`'a'`) appends new lines at the end of the existing file without erasing prior history.

---

### 3. What is the benefit of organizing question options into a dictionary {'A': ..., 'B': ...} instead of a raw list?
A. It requires zero computer memory
B. It provides direct $O(1)$ key lookup when validating the user's letter selection
C. Python dictionaries automatically sort options alphabetically
D. Dictionaries prevent syntax errors during multiplication
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mapping letter choices (`"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, `"D"`) directly to dictionary keys enables immediate constant-time validation (`if choice in options`) and retrieval of the chosen option text.

---

### 4. What does the expression user_input.strip().upper() achieve?
A. Encrypts the string into SHA-256
B. Removes leading/trailing whitespace and converts the string to uppercase, enabling forgiving and case-insensitive user input
C. Replaces spaces with underscores
D. Reverses the string
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Combining `.strip()` and `.upper()` normalizes responses like `" b "` or `"b"` into `"B"`, preventing frustrating user input rejection.

---

### 5. In entries.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), what does reverse=True signify?
A. Sorts from lowest to highest score
B. Sorts in descending order (highest score first)
C. Reverses the spelling of the contestant's name
D. Ignores negative numbers
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Setting `reverse=True` reverses the default ascending sort order, causing the highest numeric scores to appear at the top of the leaderboard.

# Practice Challenge

### Scenario: The 50-50 Lifeline Feature

In TV quiz shows, contestants can trigger a **50-50 Lifeline** that removes two incorrect choices, leaving only the correct answer and one randomly chosen wrong answer.

Add a 50-50 Lifeline feature to the Quiz Application:
1. Create a function `use_fifty_fifty(question_item)`:
   - Identifies the correct option key.
   - Gathers all 3 incorrect keys.
   - Randomly chooses 1 incorrect key to keep.
   - Returns a reduced dictionary containing only the correct option and the 1 surviving wrong option.
2. Demonstrate calling `use_fifty_fifty` on a sample question and verifying that exactly 2 options remain.

### Starter Code
```python
import random

sample_q = {
    "question": "Which keyword defines an anonymous inline function in Python?",
    "options": {
        "A": "def",
        "B": "inline",
        "C": "lambda",
        "D": "func"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The lambda keyword creates small anonymous functions."
}

# TODO: Implement use_fifty_fifty(q) that returns a dict with 2 options (the answer + 1 wrong)
```

### Complete Solution
```python
import random

sample_q = {
    "question": "Which keyword defines an anonymous inline function in Python?",
    "options": {
        "A": "def",
        "B": "inline",
        "C": "lambda",
        "D": "func"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The lambda keyword creates small anonymous functions."
}

def use_fifty_fifty(q: dict) -> dict:
    correct_key = q["answer"]
    wrong_keys = [k for k in q["options"].keys() if k != correct_key]
    
    # Pick one wrong key to keep
    surviving_wrong = random.choice(wrong_keys)
    
    # Return filtered options containing only correct and surviving wrong
    active_keys = sorted([correct_key, surviving_wrong])
    filtered_options = {k: q["options"][k] for k in active_keys}
    return filtered_options

# Test Lifeline
print(f"Original Options: {sample_q['options']}")
lifeline_options = use_fifty_fifty(sample_q)
print(f"\nAfter 50-50 Lifeline:")
for k, v in lifeline_options.items():
    print(f"  [{k}] {v}")

assert len(lifeline_options) == 2
assert sample_q["answer"] in lifeline_options
print("\n[SUCCESS] 50-50 Lifeline validated successfully!")
```

### Expected Output
```text
Original Options: {'A': 'def', 'B': 'inline', 'C': 'lambda', 'D': 'func'}

After 50-50 Lifeline:
  [A] def
  [C] lambda

[SUCCESS] 50-50 Lifeline validated successfully!
```
