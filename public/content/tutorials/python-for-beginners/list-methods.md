# Python List Methods: In-Place Manipulation, Searching & Timsort Mastery

Beyond basic appending and indexing, Python lists come equipped with an arsenal of optimized built-in methods. These methods allow you to search, tally frequencies, invert order, and sort complex datasets using C-level internal speed.

A critical milestone in mastering Python lists is distinguishing between methods that **mutate in-place** (returning `None`, such as `list.sort()` and `list.reverse()`) and functions that **produce a new copy** (such as `sorted()` and `reversed()`).

## Real-World Analogy: The Indian Wedding Guest Register & Trousseau Sorting

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    LIST METHODS REAL-WORLD ANALOGY                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. COUNT & INDEX (The Attendance Auditor):
     - At a large wedding reception in Lucknow, the manager flips through
       the guest book.
     - count("Sharma Family"): Checks how many separate times the Sharma
       family signed the entry ledger.
     - index("Chief Guest"): Instantly pinpoints the exact line number
       where the chief guest's signature first appears.

  2. SORT vs SORTED (Repainting the Wall vs Framing a Photograph):
     - list.sort(): You physically rearrange the library shelves in
       alphabetical order. The original arrangement is modified forever.
       Returns None because the change occurred on the original shelf!
     - sorted(list): You take a panoramic photo of the bookshelf and
       digitally organize the photo. The physical shelf remains untouched;
       a brand-new sorted picture is delivered into your hands.

  3. KEY LAMBDA SORTING (Arranging Wedding Gifts by Value):
     - Instead of arranging gift boxes alphabetically by brand name, you
       instruct the supervisor: "Sort them based on their weight in grams!"
     - The 'key' function extracts the specific comparison criteria.

## Visual Architecture: `sort()` vs `sorted()` Comparison

```
===========================================================================
                IN-PLACE MUTATION vs INDEPENDENT RETURN
===========================================================================

  1. list.sort() (In-Place Mutation):
     scores = [40, 10, 30]
     result = scores.sort()

     scores ---> [10, 30, 40]   (Original object rearranged in-place)
     result ---> None           (Never assign result = scores.sort()!)

  2. sorted(iterable) (Generates New Sorted Object):
     scores = [40, 10, 30]
     new_scores = sorted(scores)

     scores     ---> [40, 10, 30]   (Untouched original sequence!)
     new_scores ---> [10, 30, 40]   (Fresh, independent list object)
```

## 1. Searching and Counting: `index()` and `count()`

Use `count()` to calculate frequency and `index()` to locate an item's first occurrence:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Searching & Counting Elements
# ==========================================================

poll_votes = ["Option A", "Option B", "Option A", "Option C", "Option A", "Option B"]

# 1. count(item): Total number of occurrences
votes_a = poll_votes.count("Option A")
votes_c = poll_votes.count("Option C")
votes_d = poll_votes.count("Option D")  # Returns 0 for missing items
print(f"Votes for A: {votes_a}")
print(f"Votes for C: {votes_c}")
print(f"Votes for D: {votes_d}")

# 2. index(item, [start, [stop]]): Index of FIRST occurrence
first_b_index = poll_votes.index("Option B")
print(f"First vote for Option B found at index: {first_b_index}")

# Search within a slice window [start, stop]:
second_b_index = poll_votes.index("Option B", first_b_index + 1)
print(f"Second vote for Option B found at index: {second_b_index}")

# Defensive index lookup
candidate = "Option Z"
if candidate in poll_votes:
    print(poll_votes.index(candidate))
else:
    print(f"'{candidate}' not found in poll results!")
```

```text
Output:
Votes for A: 3
Votes for C: 1
Votes for D: 0
First vote for Option B found at index: 1
Second vote for Option B found at index: 5
'Option Z' not found in poll results!
```

---

## 2. Reversing Order: `reverse()` vs `reversed()`

Reversing inverts the order of elements:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Inverting List Order
# ==========================================================

countdown = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# 1. list.reverse() mutates the list in-place and returns None
countdown.reverse()
print(f"After in-place reverse(): {countdown}")

# 2. reversed(seq) returns a memory-efficient iterator without touching original
cities = ["Varanasi", "Prayagraj", "Ayodhya"]
rev_iterator = reversed(cities)
rev_list = list(rev_iterator)

print(f"Original cities:   {cities}")
print(f"Reversed new list: {rev_list}")
```

```text
Output:
After in-place reverse(): [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Original cities:   ['Varanasi', 'Prayagraj', 'Ayodhya']
Reversed new list: ['Ayodhya', 'Prayagraj', 'Varanasi']
```

## 3. Sorting with Timsort: `sort()` and `sorted()`

Python employs **Timsort** (a hybrid of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort designed by Tim Peters) that runs in $O(n \log n)$ time with rock-solid algorithmic stability:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Sorting Fundamentals and Key Functions
# ==========================================================

temperatures = [38.5, 42.1, 35.0, 39.8, 41.2]

# 1. In-place ascending sort
temperatures.sort()
print(f"Ascending sort:  {temperatures}")

# 2. In-place descending sort with reverse=True
temperatures.sort(reverse=True)
print(f"Descending sort: {temperatures}")

# 3. Custom Key Sorting (Case-Insensitive)
students = ["rohit", "Aarav", "deepa", "Bikram", "chitra"]
students.sort(key=str.lower)
print(f"Alphabetical case-insensitive: {students}")

# 4. Sorting by custom attribute (length of string)
words = ["Elephant", "Cat", "Hippopotamus", "Dog"]
words.sort(key=len)
print(f"Sorted by word length: {words}")
```

```text
Output:
Ascending sort:  [35.0, 38.5, 39.8, 41.2, 42.1]
Descending sort: [42.1, 41.2, 39.8, 38.5, 35.0]
Alphabetical case-insensitive: ['Aarav', 'Bikram', 'chitra', 'deepa', 'rohit']
Sorted by word length: ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Elephant', 'Hippopotamus']
```

## 4. Aggregations on Lists: `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()`

Standard built-in functions seamlessly evaluate list contents:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 4: Numeric List Statistics
# ==========================================================

marks = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

print(f"Minimum Mark: {min(marks)}")
print(f"Maximum Mark: {max(marks)}")
print(f"Total Sum:    {sum(marks)}")
print(f"Class Average: {sum(marks) / len(marks):.2f}")
```

```text
Output:
Minimum Mark: 78
Maximum Mark: 96
Total Sum:    439
Class Average: 87.80
```

## Do's and Don'ts: List Methods

| Scenario | ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Pythonic Idiom |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assigning Sort Result** | `my_list = my_list.sort()` (Destroys list into `None`!) | `my_list.sort()` OR `new_list = sorted(my_list)` |
| **Check Item Count** | Iterating with counter loop | `my_list.count(target)` |
| **Safe Index Lookup** | `pos = my_list.index(x)` unchecked | `if x in my_list: pos = my_list.index(x)` |
| **Case-Insensitive Sort** | Writing manual lowercase transforms | `names.sort(key=str.lower)` |
| **Find Max/Min** | Writing custom comparison loops | Use built-in `max(items)` / `min(items)` |

## Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What happens if a developer writes `scores = scores.sort()` in their code?
A. `scores` becomes sorted in ascending order
B. `scores` becomes sorted in descending order
C. `scores` becomes `None`, destroying the original data
D. Python raises a `TypeError`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `list.sort()` sorts the list in-place and returns `None`. Assigning `scores = scores.sort()` rebinds the variable `scores` to `None`, causing data loss. To create a new sorted list, use `scores = sorted(scores)`.

---

### 2. What will `items.count("Z")` return if `"Z"` is not present in `items`?
A. `None`
B. `-1`
C. `ValueError`
D. `0`

**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Unlike `list.index(x)` which raises `ValueError` when an element is absent, `list.count(x)` safely returns `0` when the element does not exist.

---

### 3. How does Python's Timsort algorithm sort strings when `key=len` is specified?
A. Alphabetically by first character
B. Numerically by total string character length
C. By ASCII sum of all characters
D. Randomly

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The `key` parameter accepts a callable that transforms each element into a comparison proxy. When `key=len` is passed, items are ordered based on the numeric value returned by `len(item)`.

---

### 4. What is the output of the following snippet?
```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40]
print(nums.index(20))
```
A. 1
B. 3
C. `[1, 3]`
D. 2

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `list.index(x)` returns the zero-based index of the *first* occurrence of `x`. The first `20` is at index 1.

---

### 5. Which of the following functions sorts an iterable WITHOUT modifying the original sequence?
A. `list.sort()`
B. `sorted()`
C. `list.reverse()`
D. `list.order()`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `sorted()` is a Python built-in function that takes any iterable and returns a brand-new sorted list while leaving the original input sequence completely unmodified.

## Hands-On Practice Challenge: E-Commerce Product Catalog Filter

Write a program that manages an e-commerce inventory of products represented as tuples `(Product Name, Price INR, Rating)`. Implement sorting by price ascending, sorting by rating descending using lambda key functions, and computing catalog statistics (most expensive item, cheapest item, average price).

### Starter Script & Complete Solution

```python
# ==========================================================
# Challenge: E-Commerce Product Catalog Sorter
# ==========================================================

products = [
    ("Noise-Cancelling Headphones", 4999.0, 4.6),
    ("Mechanical Gaming Keyboard", 2850.0, 4.4),
    ("Ergonomic Wireless Mouse", 1299.0, 4.8),
    ("27-inch 4K Monitor", 24500.0, 4.7),
    ("USB-C Fast Charging Cable", 449.0, 4.2)
]

print("=== INITIAL INVENTORY ===")
for p in products:
    print(f"  {p[0]:<30} | Rs {p[1]:>8.2f} | Rating: {p[2]} stars")

# 1. Sort inventory by Price (Ascending - Cheapest First)
cheapest_first = sorted(products, key=lambda item: item[1])
print("\n--- PRODUCTS: BUDGET TO PREMIUM ---")
for p in cheapest_first:
    print(f"  Rs {p[1]:>8.2f} -> {p[0]}")

# 2. Sort inventory by Customer Rating (Descending - Highest Rated First)
top_rated = sorted(products, key=lambda item: item[2], reverse=True)
print("\n--- PRODUCTS: HIGHEST CUSTOMER RATINGS ---")
for p in top_rated:
    print(f"  {p[2]} Stars -> {p[0]}")

# 3. Catalog Price Analytics
prices = [p[1] for p in products]
print("\n=== CATALOG PRICE ANALYTICS ===")
print(f"Total Products:  {len(products)}")
print(f"Cheapest Item:   Rs {min(prices):.2f}")
print(f"Most Expensive:  Rs {max(prices):.2f}")
print(f"Average Price:   Rs {sum(prices) / len(prices):.2f}")
