# Python Set Methods: Relational Comparisons, Subsets, Supersets & Disjoint Tests

Beyond standard additions, deletions, and mathematical unions, Python sets feature specialized **relational methods** designed to test inclusion, containment, and mutual exclusivity between different groups of data.

Methods like `issubset()`, `issuperset()`, and `isdisjoint()` allow applications to check access permissions, audit regulatory compliance, and ensure data partition integrity in near-instantaneous time.

## Real-World Analogy: Indian Federal States & Airline Meal Trays

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    SET METHODS REAL-WORLD ANALOGY                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. SUBSET (State within a Republic):
     - Maharashtra Cities: {"Mumbai", "Pune", "Nagpur"}
     - Indian Cities:      {"Mumbai", "Delhi", "Pune", "Kolkata", "Nagpur"}
     - Every Maharashtra city is an Indian city. Therefore, Maharashtra
       is a SUBSET of India (maharashtra.issubset(india) is True).

  2. SUPERSET (The Republic Encompassing the State):
     - India contains all Maharashtra cities plus many more.
     - Therefore, India is a SUPERSET of Maharashtra
       (india.issuperset(maharashtra) is True).

  3. DISJOINT (Pure Veg vs Halal/Kosher Airline Meal Trays):
     - In-flight catering prepares two trays:
       Tray A (Pure Vegetarian):   {"Paneer Tikka", "Roti", "Gulab Jamun"}
       Tray B (Strict Non-Veg):    {"Mutton Biryani", "Egg Curry"}
     - These trays share ZERO common ingredients. Their intersection is empty!
     - They are DISJOINT sets (tray_a.isdisjoint(tray_b) is True).

===========================================================================
             SET RELATIONSHIPS: SUBSET, SUPERSET & DISJOINT
===========================================================================

  1. SUBSET & SUPERSET (Containment)
     +---------------------------------------------------------+
     | Super Set B: Indian Citizens                            |
     |   "Delhi Resident", "Kolkata Resident"                  |
     |   +-------------------------------------------------+   |
     |   | Sub Set A: Mumbai Residents                     |   |
     |   |   "Bandra Resident", "Colaba Resident"          |   |
     |   +-------------------------------------------------+   |
     +---------------------------------------------------------+
     A.issubset(B)   --> True (All elements of A are inside B)
     B.issuperset(A) --> True (B encloses all of A)

  2. DISJOINT (Mutual Exclusivity)
     +---------------------+        +---------------------+
     | Set X: Even Numbers |        | Set Y: Odd Numbers  |
     |      {2, 4, 6}      |   X    |      {1, 3, 5}      |
     +---------------------+        +---------------------+
     X.isdisjoint(Y) --> True (Zero overlapping elements!)
```

## 1. Subset Testing: `issubset()` and `<=`

A set $A$ is a subset of set $B$ if every element belonging to $A$ also belongs to $B$:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Testing Subsets
# ==========================================================

mandatory_curriculum = {"Python", "Git"}
student_completed = {"HTML", "CSS", "Python", "Git", "SQL"}

# 1. issubset() method (Accepts any iterable argument)
is_eligible_method = mandatory_curriculum.issubset(student_completed)
print(f"issubset() method check: {is_eligible_method}")

# 2. <= operator (Both operands must be sets)
is_eligible_op = mandatory_curriculum <= student_completed
print(f"<= operator check:        {is_eligible_op}")

# 3. Proper Subset (<): Must be a subset, but NOT identical in size
all_skills = {"Python", "Git"}
print(f"Is subset of itself?        {all_skills <= all_skills}")
print(f"Is PROPER subset of itself? {all_skills < all_skills} (False because they are equal!)")
```

```text
Output:
issubset() method check: True
<= operator check:        True
Is subset of itself?        True
Is PROPER subset of itself? False (False because they are equal!)
```

---

## 2. Superset Testing: `issuperset()` and `>=`

A set $B$ is a superset of set $A$ if $B$ contains every element present in $A$:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Testing Supersets
# ==========================================================

authorized_admin_roles = {"read", "write", "delete", "audit", "billing"}
user_requested_roles = {"read", "write"}

# Verify if system security level encompasses all requested permissions
can_grant = authorized_admin_roles.issuperset(user_requested_roles)
print(f"Admin system is superset: {can_grant}")

# Using >= operator
print(f"Using >= operator:        {authorized_admin_roles >= user_requested_roles}")
```

```text
Output:
Admin system is superset: True
Using >= operator:        True
```

---

## 3. Disjoint Testing: `isdisjoint()`

Two sets are **disjoint** if they have no elements in common ($A \cap B = \emptyset$):

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Testing Mutual Exclusivity
# ==========================================================

morning_shift_guards = {"Ramesh", "Suresh", "Dinesh"}
night_shift_guards = {"Mahesh", "Kamlesh", "Ganesh"}
double_shift_guards = {"Ramesh", "Mukesh"}

# 1. Zero overlap test
is_conflict_free = morning_shift_guards.isdisjoint(night_shift_guards)
print(f"Are morning & night shifts disjoint? {is_conflict_free} (No overlap!)")

# 2. Overlap detected (Ramesh is in both)
has_double_shift = morning_shift_guards.isdisjoint(double_shift_guards)
print(f"Are morning & double shifts disjoint? {has_double_shift} (Overlap found!)")
```

```text
Output:
Are morning & night shifts disjoint? True (No overlap!)
Are morning & double shifts disjoint? False (Overlap found!)
```

---

## 4. In-Place Update Methods Suite

Python provides dedicated mutation methods corresponding to set operations:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 4: In-Place Set Mutations
# ==========================================================

active_ports = {80, 443, 8080, 22, 3306}
print(f"Initial Ports: {active_ports}")

# 1. intersection_update(): Keep only standard web ports
standard_web = {80, 443, 8080}
active_ports.intersection_update(standard_web)
print(f"After intersection_update: {active_ports}")

# 2. difference_update(): Remove insecure port 80
insecure = {80}
active_ports.difference_update(insecure)
print(f"After difference_update:   {active_ports}")

# 3. symmetric_difference_update(): Toggle ports
toggle_ports = {443, 8443}
active_ports.symmetric_difference_update(toggle_ports)
print(f"After sym_diff_update:     {active_ports}")
```

```text
Output:
Initial Ports: {3306, 80, 8080, 443, 22}
After intersection_update: {80, 8080, 443}
After difference_update:   {8080, 443}
After sym_diff_update:     {8080, 8443}
```

## Do's and Don'ts: Set Methods

| Scenario | ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Pythonic Idiom |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test No Shared Items** | `len(s1 & s2) == 0` (Allocates full intersection set!) | `s1.isdisjoint(s2)` (Halts on first match! Instant) |
| **Test Complete Coverage** | Looping through every item with `if x in:` | `required.issubset(possessed)` |
| **Method with Lists** | `s <= [1, 2, 3]` (TypeError) | `s.issubset([1, 2, 3])` (Method accepts iterables) |
| **Clone Set** | `copy_s = s` (Reference aliasing bug) | `copy_s = s.copy()` (Shallow copy) |

## Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What will `{1, 2}.issubset({1, 2, 3})` return?
A. `False`
B. `True`
C. `None`
D. `TypeError`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Every element in `{1, 2}` is also present in `{1, 2, 3}`. Therefore, `{1, 2}` is a valid subset of `{1, 2, 3}`, returning `True`.

---

### 2. What is the most performance-efficient way to check if two sets share NO common elements?
A. `len(a & b) == 0`
B. `a.isdisjoint(b)`
C. `[x for x in a if x in b] == []`
D. `a - b == a`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `a.isdisjoint(b)` short-circuits and terminates the instant it discovers the very first common element without constructing an intermediate intersection set in memory, making it the most memory and CPU-efficient method.

---

### 3. What is the difference between `A <= B` and `A < B` in Python set comparisons?
A. `A <= B` tests if A is a subset (can be equal to B), while `A < B` tests if A is a proper subset (must be strictly smaller than B)
B. `A < B` works only with numbers
C. `A <= B` is deprecated
D. There is no difference

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `<=` tests standard subset inclusion where the sets may be identical. `<` tests strict proper subset inclusion, requiring that $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$.

---

### 4. What will `{10, 20}.isdisjoint({30, 40})` return?
A. `True`
B. `False`
C. `set()`
D. `KeyError`

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The two sets share no overlapping elements ($A \cap B = \emptyset$), so they are disjoint, returning `True`.

---

### 5. What will `s.issuperset(["A", "B"])` return if `s = {"A", "B", "C"}`?
A. `TypeError: argument must be a set`
B. `True`
C. `False`
D. `None`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Unlike the `>=` operator which requires both operands to be sets, the `.issuperset()` method accepts any iterable (such as a list) and checks if the set contains all elements from that iterable.

## Hands-On Practice Challenge: Cloud Identity IAM Permission Auditor

Build an Identity & Access Management (IAM) role validator for a corporate cloud platform. Verify whether a developer role has sufficient privileges to deploy code (`issubset`), confirm whether the Root Admin role encompasses all compliance permissions (`issuperset`), and verify that a Guest Contractor role has zero access to Restricted Financial Data (`isdisjoint`).

### Starter Script & Complete Solution

```python
# ==========================================================
# Challenge: Cloud IAM Security Access Auditor
# ==========================================================

# Standard IAM System Roles & Permissions
SYSTEM_SUPER_ADMIN_CAPABILITIES = {
    "ec2_create", "ec2_delete", "s3_read", "s3_write", 
    "billing_view", "iam_modify", "audit_logs"
}

REQUIRED_DEPLOYER_PERMISSIONS = {"ec2_create", "s3_write"}
RESTRICTED_FINANCIAL_PERMISSIONS = {"billing_view", "audit_logs"}

# Assigned User Group Permissions
dev_lead_role = {"ec2_create", "s3_read", "s3_write", "db_migrate"}
guest_contractor_role = {"s3_read", "frontend_upload"}

print("=== CLOUD IAM ACCESS AUDIT PROTOCOL ===")

# 1. Audit Deployer Eligibility (issubset)
can_dev_lead_deploy = REQUIRED_DEPLOYER_PERMISSIONS.issubset(dev_lead_role)
print(f"Can Dev Lead deploy applications? {can_dev_lead_deploy} (Has ec2_create & s3_write)")

# 2. Audit Super Admin Compliance (issuperset)
is_admin_compliant = SYSTEM_SUPER_ADMIN_CAPABILITIES.issuperset(RESTRICTED_FINANCIAL_PERMISSIONS)
print(f"Super Admin possesses all financial controls? {is_admin_compliant}")

# 3. Security Breach Isolation Check (isdisjoint)
# Ensure Guest Contractor has ZERO access to restricted financial data
is_guest_safe = guest_contractor_role.isdisjoint(RESTRICTED_FINANCIAL_PERMISSIONS)
print(f"Is Guest Contractor isolated from Financial Data? {is_guest_safe}")

if not is_guest_safe:
    print("[SECURITY BREACH] Guest Contractor has unauthorized financial privileges!")
else:
    print("[SECURITY VERIFIED] Zero privilege overlap for external contractors.")
```

```text
Output:
=== CLOUD IAM ACCESS AUDIT PROTOCOL ===
Can Dev Lead deploy applications? True (Has ec2_create & s3_write)
Super Admin possesses all financial controls? True
Is Guest Contractor isolated from Financial Data? True
[SECURITY VERIFIED] Zero privilege overlap for external contractors.
```
