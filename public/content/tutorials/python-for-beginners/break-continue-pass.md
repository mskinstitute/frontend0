# Loop Control Statements in Python: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`

Loops are designed to execute iteratively until their condition turns `False` or their sequence runs out of items. However, real-world algorithms frequently encounter conditions where the standard flow must be redirected:

- An item has been discovered early, rendering further search unnecessary (**`break`**).
- An invalid or corrupted record is encountered that must be skipped without aborting the entire batch (**`continue`**).
- A syntactically empty block must be left as a placeholder for future implementation (**`pass`**).

Python provides three distinct keywords—`break`, `continue`, and `pass`—to manage these granular control flow requirements.

|                    LOOP CONTROL REAL-WORLD ANALOGIES                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. BREAK (EARLY TERMINATION):
     - An Indian Railways TTE walks down the 3AC coach searching for Dr. Verma
       who was paged for a medical emergency.
     - TTE inspects Berth 1, Berth 2, Berth 3...
     - At Berth 14, TTE finds Dr. Verma:
       -> BREAK! Stop checking Berths 15 through 72. Mission accomplished!

  2. CONTINUE (SKIP ITERATION):
     - The TTE is checking ticket concessions for passenger discounts.
     - Passenger at Berth 15 has an infant (below 5 years):
       -> Infants don't require ticket punching.
       -> CONTINUE! Skip fee calculations for this passenger, jump straight
          to Berth 16.

  3. PASS (NULL OPERATION / PLACEHOLDER):
     - Berth 17 is marked "VIP QUOTA - TO BE BOARDED AT KANPUR".
     - Currently empty. TTE does nothing right now, but cannot skip the berth
       from the manifest records.
     - PASS! Maintain the placeholder without performing any action.

## 1. The `break` Statement (Immediate Loop Termination)

The `break` statement halts the execution of the innermost loop immediately and moves program control to the statement directly following the loop block:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Linear Search with Early break
# ==========================================================

candidate_roll_numbers = [1021, 1045, 1089, 1102, 1156, 1200]
target_roll = 1089

found_index = -1

for index, roll in enumerate(candidate_roll_numbers):
    print(f"Checking index {index}: Roll No {roll}...")
    if roll == target_roll:
        found_index = index
        print(f"--> Target {target_roll} found at index {found_index}! Terminating loop.")
        break  # Halts search; avoids scanning 1102, 1156, 1200

print(f"Search complete. Target index: {found_index}")
```

**Output:**
```text
Checking index 0: Roll No 1021...
Checking index 1: Roll No 1045...
Checking index 2: Roll No 1089...
--> Target 1089 found at index 2! Terminating loop.
Search complete. Target index: 2
```

Notice how Python halted at index 2 without wasting time scanning the remaining elements.

---

## 2. The `continue` Statement (Skip to Next Iteration)

The `continue` statement rejects all remaining code in the current iteration and jumps directly back to the top of the loop to begin the next iteration:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Data Cleansing with continue
# ==========================================================

# Raw sensor data containing noisy readings (None or negative values)
sensor_readings = [28.4, -999.0, 29.1, None, 31.0, -1.0, 30.5]
valid_readings = []

print("=== SENSOR TELEMETRY SANITATION PIPELINE ===")

for reading in sensor_readings:
    # Filter corrupted data
    if reading is None or reading < 0:
        print(f"  [SKIPPED] Discarding corrupted reading: {reading}")
        continue  # Skip to the next sensor reading immediately
        
    # Process valid data
    valid_readings.append(reading)
    print(f"  [ACCEPTED] Recorded valid temperature: {reading}°C")

average_temp = sum(valid_readings) / len(valid_readings)
print(f"\nClean Readings: {valid_readings}")
print(f"Calculated Mean Temperature: {average_temp:.2f}°C")
```

**Output:**
```text
=== SENSOR TELEMETRY SANITATION PIPELINE ===
  [ACCEPTED] Recorded valid temperature: 28.4°C
  [SKIPPED] Discarding corrupted reading: -999.0
  [ACCEPTED] Recorded valid temperature: 29.1°C
  [SKIPPED] Discarding corrupted reading: None
  [ACCEPTED] Recorded valid temperature: 31.0°C
  [SKIPPED] Discarding corrupted reading: -1.0
  [ACCEPTED] Recorded valid temperature: 30.5°C

Clean Readings: [28.4, 29.1, 31.0, 30.5]
Calculated Mean Temperature: 29.75°C
```

## 3. The `pass` Statement (The Syntactic Null Operation)

In Python, code blocks defined by indentation cannot be empty. Writing an empty `if`, `for`, `while`, or `def` block causes an `IndentationError: expected an indented block`.

The `pass` statement is a **null operation (no-op)**: when executed, absolutely nothing happens. It serves as a syntactical placeholder while scaffolding architecture:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: pass as Architectural Scaffold
# ==========================================================

class FutureUPIPaymentGateway:
    def process_credit_card(self, card_data):
        pass  # Planned for Sprint 4 release
        
    def process_net_banking(self, bank_code):
        pass  # Pending RBI API approval
        
    def process_upi_qr(self, vpa):
        return f"QR generated for {vpa}"

# Filtering without doing anything on a specific branch:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for n in numbers:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pass  # Do nothing for evens
    else:
        print(f"Odd Number: {n}")
```

**Output:**
```text
Odd Number: 1
Odd Number: 3
Odd Number: 5
```

## 4. Key Differences Summary Table

| Attribute | `break` | `continue` | `pass` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Action** | Terminates the entire loop immediately. | Skips the rest of current cycle; jumps to next iteration. | Does nothing; executes following line normally. |
| **Execution Continues At** | Statement outside the loop. | Header of the next loop iteration. | Next statement in the same block. |
| **Primary Use Case** | Early search termination, circuit-breakers. | Data validation, discarding noise/errors. | Code scaffolding, empty stubs, placeholder functions. |
| **Leaves Loop?** | **YES** | **NO** | **NO** |

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts Best Practices

| Best Practice (DO) | Dangerous Anti-Pattern (DON'T) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO** use `break` when searching for an element to prevent wasteful $O(N)$ CPU cycles. | **DON'T** use `break` excessively to replace clean loop conditions; keep loop invariants explicit. |
| **DO** use `continue` at the top of loops to filter out bad data early (guard clause style). | **DON'T** stack 5 nested if statements when a single `continue` at the top cleanly skips invalid entries. |
| **DO** use `pass` when creating stub methods or satisfying abstract syntax requirements. | **DON'T** confuse `pass` with `continue`; `pass` does NOT skip to the next iteration! |

---

## Quick Revision Summary

- **`break`** terminates the innermost enclosing loop prematurely and resumes execution immediately outside the loop.
- **`continue`** abandons the remainder of the current iteration and jumps directly to the beginning of the next cycle.
- **`pass`** is a syntactical placeholder (no-op) required because Python does not allow empty code blocks.
- When `break` occurs inside an inner nested loop, only that specific inner loop terminates.
- `pass` does **not** alter control flow; code continues running straight through to the next line.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What will be printed by the following code?
```python
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num, end=" ")
```
A. 1 2 3
B. 1 2
C. 1 2 4 5
D. 3 4 5

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When `num` reaches 3, the `if num == 3:` condition evaluates to `True`, triggering `break`. The loop terminates immediately before executing `print(num)`. Only `1 2 ` are printed.

---

### 2. What will be printed by the following code?
```python
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num, end=" ")
```
A. 1 2
B. 1 2 4 5
C. 1 2 3 4 5
D. 3

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When `num` is 3, `continue` executes, skipping the `print` statement for that specific iteration and immediately advancing to `num = 4`. Thus, 3 is omitted, printing `1 2 4 5 `.

---

### 3. What is the functional effect of the `pass` keyword in Python?
A. It terminates the entire script with exit code 0
B. It skips the current iteration of the loop like `continue`
C. It acts as a null operation (no-op), serving as a syntactic placeholder without altering execution flow
D. It passes variables from child to parent scope

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `pass` does absolutely nothing. It is used exclusively to satisfy Python's syntactic requirement that an indented block must contain at least one statement.

---

### 4. What will happen if a loop encounters a `pass` statement?
A. The loop resets back to iteration 0
B. Python skips all code beneath `pass` in that block
C. The statement following `pass` on the next line executes normally
D. An `IndentationWarning` is emitted

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Unlike `break` (which exits) or `continue` (which jumps to next iteration), `pass` does not divert control flow. The interpreter simply continues executing the very next statement inside the block.

---

### 5. Consider a nested loop where the inner loop executes `break`. What happens to the outer loop?
A. Both loops terminate completely
B. Only the inner loop terminates; the outer loop continues running normally
C. The outer loop resets to its initial value
D. Python raises a `LoopInterrupt` exception

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `break` only terminates the innermost loop that directly encloses it. The outer loop remains in execution and proceeds with its next iteration.

# Practice Challenge: GST Tax Invoice Data Sanitizer & Fraud Sentinel

Build an automated tax audit and data sanitation pipeline for the Indian Goods and Services Tax (GST) Network. 

The audit pipeline processes a batch of incoming vendor invoices. The system must apply fine-grained loop control:

1. **Continue Rule (Data Cleaning):** If an invoice has a negative amount (`amount_inr < 0`) or an invalid GSTIN string (`len(gstin) != 15`), print a warning and use **`continue`** to skip the record.
2. **Break Rule (Fraud Circuit-Breaker):** If an invoice is flagged with `"SUSPECTED_HAWALA_SHELL"` in the remarks, the system must immediately trigger an emergency compliance halt using **`break`** to freeze the audit batch for regulatory investigation.
3. **Pass Rule (Placeholder Scaffold):** If the invoice payment method is `"SEZ_TAX_EXEMPT"`, use **`pass`** as a placeholder for the future SEZ duty refund calculator, but still allow normal processing.
4. Calculate total valid revenue processed before any circuit-breaker halt.
