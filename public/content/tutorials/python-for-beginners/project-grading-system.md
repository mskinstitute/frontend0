# Capstone Project: Automated Academic Merit & Grading Engine

In this capstone project for Chapter 12, we will integrate all conditional control flow techniques—including `if-elif-else` ladders, nested conditions, guard clauses, short-hand guards, and ternary expressions—to build a production-grade **Academic Merit & Report Card Processing Engine**.

Real-world grading systems (such as those used by **CBSE, ICSE, or State Technical Universities**) do not simply look at an aggregate percentage. They enforce multi-tiered academic regulations:
1. **Attendance Compliance:** Minimum 75% classroom attendance (with medical condonation clauses).
2. **Subject-Level Clearance:** Passing cutoff (minimum 33% or 40%) in every individual subject.
3. **Compartment / Backlog Classification:** Differentiating students who failed 1 subject versus those who failed multiple.
4. **Honors & Distinction:** Awarding Dean's List or Gold Medals for top tier performers.

## 4. Key Architectural Patterns Mastered in this Project

1. **Gatekeeper Guard Clauses:** Notice how Stage 1 checks attendance first. If a candidate is debarred, the function exits immediately with a clean dictionary, completely bypassing unnecessary grade math.
2. **Failure Accumulation:** Rather than aborting at the first failed subject, Stage 2 aggregates all failed subjects into a list (`failed_subjects`). This permits counting the exact number of backlogs to differentiate between a single *Compartment* vs. an *Essential Repeat*.
3. **Hierarchical Boundary Mapping:** Stage 3 maps percentages to letter grades from highest to lowest (`>= 91`, `>= 81`, etc.). Because `elif` short-circuits upon the first match, no compound checks like `91 <= pct <= 100` are needed.
4. **Ternary Badge Assignment:** Stage 4 utilizes chained ternary expressions to cleanly assign the honors accolade in a single readable block.

---

## Quick Revision Summary

- Production-grade grading pipelines apply **layered validation**: compliance gates -> subject clearance -> aggregate mapping -> honors classification.
- Guard clauses keep code flat and maintainable by terminating invalid states early.
- Always check grading boundaries in strictly **descending order** (`90`, `80`, `70`, etc.) when using `if-elif-else` ladders.
- Chained ternary expressions provide an elegant, declarative way to assign categorical status badges.

---

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. In an `if-elif-else` ladder checking numerical grades, why should percentage thresholds be checked in descending order (e.g. >=90, then >=80, then >=70)?
A. Because Python sorts `elif` statements automatically at runtime
B. Because an `elif` block exits upon finding the first True condition; ascending order would cause 95% to trigger the >=40% check first
C. Because Python raises an `IndentationError` if numerical comparisons are not in order
D. Descending order is required by the PEP 8 linter

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In Python, an `if-elif` chain executes sequentially and halts at the very first branch that evaluates to `True`. If you checked `if marks >= 40:` first, a score of 95 would match that condition and receive a passing 'D' grade instead of reaching the 'A' grade branch.

---

### 2. What design pattern is utilized when a student's attendance is validated and rejected at the very beginning of the function before any grade math runs?
A. Singleton Pattern
B. Guard Clause (Bouncer Pattern / Early Exit)
C. Factory Method
D. Arrow Anti-Pattern

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Guard clauses validate prerequisite criteria at the entrance of a function and return or raise an error immediately if preconditions fail, keeping the subsequent "happy path" clean and unindented.

---

### 3. Consider a student with marks `[95, 90, 88, 30]`. In our project grading engine with a subject passing cutoff of 35, what will their status be?
A. PROMOTED (Passed on aggregate)
B. DEBARRED
C. COMPARTMENT
D. ESSENTIAL REPEAT

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The student scored 30 in the fourth subject, which is below the 35 cutoff. Because exactly 1 subject was failed, the engine assigns the status `"COMPARTMENT"` for supplementary examination.

---

### 4. What will be the result of the following ternary expression when `pct = 96.0`?
```python
badge = "Gold" if pct >= 95.0 else "Silver" if pct >= 80.0 else "Bronze"
```
A. Gold
B. Silver
C. Bronze
D. Gold and Silver

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Since `pct >= 95.0` (96.0 >= 95.0) is `True`, the expression immediately resolves to `"Gold"` and skips the rest of the ternary chain.

---

### 5. Why is accumulating failed subjects into a list (`failed_subjects.append(sub)`) better than using a boolean flag (`has_failed = True`)?
A. Lists consume less memory than boolean flags in Python
B. A list allows determining the exact backlog count (differentiating 1 subject for Compartment vs 2+ for Repeat) as well as displaying subject names
C. Boolean flags cannot be used in for-loops
D. Lists run on multi-threaded CPU cores in Python

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Collecting failed subjects in a list provides rich diagnostic data: `len(failed_subjects)` gives the backlog count needed for policy decisions, and the list elements provide the exact names of the subjects that need re-examination.

# Practice Challenge: Semester GPA (SGPA) & Credit Points Calculator

Extend the academic evaluation system to calculate **Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)** for an engineering degree program at an Indian University (AKTU / Anna University / VTU). 

Each course carries a specific number of **credit units** (e.g., Data Structures: 4 credits, Mathematics: 4 credits, Physics Lab: 2 credits).

### Requirements:
1. **Grade Point Mapping:**
   - 90–100: Grade `O` (10 GP)
   - 80–89: Grade `A+` (9 GP)
   - 70–79: Grade `A` (8 GP)
   - 60–69: Grade `B+` (7 GP)
   - 50–59: Grade `B` (6 GP)
   - 40–49: Grade `C` (5 GP)
   - Below 40: Grade `F` (0 GP - Fail)
2. **SGPA Formula:**
   $$\text{SGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Course Credits} \times \text{Grade Points})}{\sum \text{Total Course Credits}}$$
3. **Academic Standing:**
   - If any course has Grade `F`, Academic Standing is `"BACKLOG"`.
   - Else if $\text{SGPA} \ge 8.5$: `"FIRST CLASS WITH DISTINCTION"`.
   - Else if $\text{SGPA} \ge 6.5$: `"FIRST CLASS"`.
   - Else: `"SECOND CLASS"`.
