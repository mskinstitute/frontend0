# Creating and Accessing Python Lists: Indexing, Negative Indices, and Slicing

Once you have created a list of data, the next fundamental task is retrieving specific items from it. Whether you need the very first element, the last element, or a subset of values, Python provides an elegant and expressive indexing and slicing syntax.

Unlike languages that only allow zero-to-positive counting, Python features native **negative indexing** (counting backwards from the end) and **stride slicing** (`[start:stop:step]`), making sequence manipulation effortless and concise.

## Real-World Analogy: Indian Cricket Team Batting Order & Token Locker Keys

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  LIST ACCESSING REAL-WORLD ANALOGY                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. THE CRICKET BATTING ORDER (Positive & Negative Positions):
     - In the Indian ODI squad, the batting order has 11 players.
     - Positive Index 0 is the opening batsman (e.g., Rohit Sharma).
     - Positive Index 1 is the second opener (e.g., Shubman Gill).
     - What if you want to inspect the final tailender bowler?
       Instead of calculating len(team) - 1, Python gives you negative index:
       team[-1] is the last player, and team[-2] is the second-to-last!

  2. BANK DEPOSIT LOCKER GRID (Direct O(1) Index Access):
     - When you visit a bank vault in Mumbai, each locker has a stamped number.
     - With your key number [3], you open locker 3 in constant time O(1).
     - You don't have to inspect lockers 0, 1, and 2 first.

  3. METRO TRAIN JOURNEY SLICE (start:stop):
     - If you board a train from Station 2 up to Station 6, you ride through
       stations 2, 3, 4, and 5. Station 6 is where you exit—it is excluded!

## Visual Architecture: Dual-Directional Indexing Grid

```
===========================================================================
             DUAL-DIRECTIONAL LIST INDEXING & SLICING MAP
===========================================================================

  List Data:       ["Rohit", "Gill", "Virat", "Iyer", "Rahul", "Hardik"]

  Positive Index:      0        1        2       3       4        5
                   +--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+--------+
  Element Value:   | Rohit  |  Gill  | Virat | Iyer  | Rahul | Hardik |
                   +--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+--------+
  Negative Index:     -6       -5       -4      -3      -2       -1

  Key Observations:
  - First element: squad[0]   OR squad[-6]  --> "Rohit"
  - Last element:  squad[5]   OR squad[-1]  --> "Hardik"
  - Slice [1:4]:   Indices 1, 2, 3          --> ["Gill", "Virat", "Iyer"]
  - Excluded End:  Index 4 ("Rahul") is NEVER included in [1:4]!
```

## 1. Accessing Individual Elements (Positive & Negative Indices)

Every item in a Python list occupies an addressable slot. Accessing an element via its index runs in constant $O(1)$ time complexity.

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Positive and Negative Indexing
# ==========================================================

batting_order = ["Rohit", "Gill", "Virat", "Iyer", "Rahul", "Hardik"]

# 1. Positive indexing (Zero-based from start)
print(f"Opening Batsman [0]: {batting_order[0]}")
print(f"One-Down Batsman [2]: {batting_order[2]}")

# 2. Negative indexing (Counting backwards from the end)
print(f"Finisher [-1]:        {batting_order[-1]}")
print(f"Wicket-Keeper [-2]:   {batting_order[-2]}")

# 3. Defensive Index Handling against IndexError
requested_index = 10
try:
    print(batting_order[requested_index])
except IndexError as err:
    print(f"Index {requested_index} is out of bounds! Valid range is 0 to {len(batting_order) - 1}.")
```

```text
Output:
Opening Batsman [0]: Rohit
One-Down Batsman [2]: Virat
Finisher [-1]:        Hardik
Wicket-Keeper [-2]:   Rahul
Index 10 is out of bounds! Valid range is 0 to 5.
```

## 2. List Slicing: `[start : stop : step]`

Slicing extracts a sub-list without modifying the original parent list. The syntax follows:
$$\text{list}[\text{start} : \text{stop} : \text{step}]$$
- **`start`**: Index where extraction begins (inclusive, defaults to `0`).
- **`stop`**: Index where extraction terminates (**exclusive**, defaults to `len(list)`).
- **`step`**: Stride or interval between elements (defaults to `1`).

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: Slicing Patterns and Idioms
# ==========================================================

scores = [45, 82, 104, 38, 56, 91, 12, 77]

# 1. Basic sub-slice [start:stop]
top_order_scores = scores[0:3]
print(f"Top 3 scores [0:3]: {top_order_scores}")

# 2. Omitting start (from beginning) or stop (till end)
first_four = scores[:4]
from_fourth_onwards = scores[4:]
print(f"First four [:4]:           {first_four}")
print(f"From 4th onwards [4:]:     {from_fourth_onwards}")

# 3. Stride / Step parameter (e.g. alternate elements)
every_second_score = scores[::2]
print(f"Alternate elements [::2]:  {every_second_score}")

# 4. Reversing a list with negative step [::-1]
reversed_scores = scores[::-1]
print(f"Reversed list [::-1]:      {reversed_scores}")

# 5. Shallow Copying using full slice [:]
scores_copy = scores[:]
print(f"Scores copy is equal:     {scores_copy == scores}")
print(f"Scores copy is new object: {scores_copy is not scores}")
```

```text
Output:
Top 3 scores [0:3]: [45, 82, 104]
First four [:4]:           [45, 82, 104, 38]
From 4th onwards [4:]:     [56, 91, 12, 77]
Alternate elements [::2]:  [45, 104, 56, 12]
Reversed list [::-1]:      [77, 12, 91, 56, 38, 104, 82, 45]
Scores copy is equal:     True
Scores copy is new object: True
```

## 3. Membership Checking: `in` and `not in`

Before accessing an element or searching for its position, you can verify its presence using membership operators in clean, idiomatic English:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Membership Verification
# ==========================================================

metro_stations = ["Chandni Chowk", "New Delhi", "Rajiv Chowk", "Central Secretariat"]

search_query = "Rajiv Chowk"

if search_query in metro_stations:
    station_index = metro_stations.index(search_query)
    print(f"'{search_query}' found at Stop #{station_index}!")
else:
    print(f"'{search_query}' is not on this line.")

if "Airport T3" not in metro_stations:
    print("Notice: Transfer to Orange Line required for Airport T3.")
```

```text
Output:
'Rajiv Chowk' found at Stop #2!
Notice: Transfer to Orange Line required for Airport T3.
```

## Do's and Don'ts: List Access and Slicing

| Scenario | ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Pythonic Idiom |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Last Element Access** | `items[len(items) - 1]` | `items[-1]` (Direct negative index) |
| **First N Elements** | `items[0:n]` | `items[:n]` (Omit redundant 0) |
| **Cloning a List** | Iterating with loop + append | `clone = items[:]` or `items.copy()` |
| **Reversing Elements** | `items.reverse()` when wanting new copy | `reversed_items = items[::-1]` |
| **Out-of-Bounds Check** | Unchecked direct index | Check `0 <= index < len(items)` or `try...except IndexError` |
| **Find Item Existence** | `try: items.index(x)` | `if x in items:` (Membership operator) |

## Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Given `cities = ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Chennai", "Bengaluru"]`, what does `cities[-1]` return?
A. `"Delhi"`
B. `"Chennai"`
C. `"Bengaluru"`
D. `IndexError`

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** In Python, negative index `-1` points to the final element of the sequence, which is `"Bengaluru"`.

---

### 2. What is the result of evaluating `numbers[1:4]` on `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]`?
A. `[10, 20, 30]`
B. `[20, 30, 40]`
C. `[20, 30, 40, 50]`
D. `[10, 20, 30, 40]`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Slicing `[start:stop]` includes the start index (1) and excludes the stop index (4). Therefore, elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 are returned: `[20, 30, 40]`.

---

### 3. How do you create an exact reversed copy of `data = [1, 2, 3, 4]` using slicing?
A. `data[0:-1]`
B. `data[::-1]`
C. `data[-1:0]`
D. `data[-1:-4]`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Slicing with a step of `-1` without specifying start and stop (`data[::-1]`) traverses the entire list backwards from end to beginning, returning `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

---

### 4. What happens when you attempt to access `items[10]` on a list containing only 4 items?
A. Python returns `None`
B. Python returns an empty list `[]`
C. Python raises an `IndexError: list index out of range`
D. Python extends the list with empty slots

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Direct indexing out of bounds raises an `IndexError`. (Note that slicing outside list bounds such as `items[10:20]` returns `[]` without erroring, but direct indexing `items[10]` crashes).

---

### 5. What does the slice `letters[::2]` produce when `letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']`?
A. `['A', 'B']`
B. `['A', 'C', 'E']`
C. `['B', 'D']`
D. `['C', 'D', 'E']`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The stride `2` selects elements at indices 0, 2, and 4, which correspond to `'A'`, `'C'`, and `'E'`.

## Hands-On Practice Challenge: Exam Marksheet Analyzer

Write a Python script that takes a list of semester exam marks for 8 subjects, extracts the top 3 highest scores using sorting and slicing, grabs the bottom 2 scores with negative slicing, and reverses the chronological score list.

### Starter Script & Complete Solution

```python
# ==========================================================
# Challenge: Semester Marksheet Analyzer
# ==========================================================

# Chronological exam scores for 8 semester subjects:
semester_scores = [78, 92, 64, 88, 95, 71, 85, 90]
subject_names = [
    "Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry", 
    "Python", "Data Structures", "English", 
    "Web Tech", "Database"
]

print("=== SEMESTER EXAMINATION REPORT ===")
print(f"Total Subjects: {len(semester_scores)}")

# 1. Retrieve first subject and last subject
print(f"First Exam Score (Index 0):  {semester_scores[0]} ({subject_names[0]})")
print(f"Final Exam Score (Index -1): {semester_scores[-1]} ({subject_names[-1]})")

# 2. Extract mid-semester core subjects (indices 2 through 5)
mid_term_slice = semester_scores[2:6]
print(f"Mid-Term Core Subjects [2:6]: {mid_term_slice}")

# 3. View scores in reverse chronological order using slice
reversed_scores = semester_scores[::-1]
print(f"Scores in reverse order:      {reversed_scores}")

# 4. Identify Top 3 and Bottom 2 scores using sorted() and slicing
ranked_scores = sorted(semester_scores)  # sorts ascending
lowest_two = ranked_scores[:2]          # first 2
top_three = ranked_scores[-3:][::-1]    # last 3, presented descending

print(f"\nLowest 2 scores:  {lowest_two}")
print(f"Highest 3 scores: {top_three}")

# 5. Safe element membership check
target_score = 100
if target_score in semester_scores:
    print(f"Centum achieved at subject index {semester_scores.index(target_score)}!")
else:
    print(f"No subject achieved a perfect {target_score}. Keep practicing!")
```

```text
Output:
=== SEMESTER EXAMINATION REPORT ===
Total Subjects: 8
First Exam Score (Index 0):  78 (Mathematics)
Final Exam Score (Index -1): 90 (Database)
Mid-Term Core Subjects [2:6]: [64, 88, 95, 71]
Scores in reverse order:      [90, 85, 71, 95, 88, 64, 92, 78]

Lowest 2 scores:  [64, 71]
Highest 3 scores: [95, 92, 90]
No subject achieved a perfect 100. Keep practicing!
