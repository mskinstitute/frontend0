# Nested Sets in Python: The `frozenset` Immutable Solution & Powerset Theory

In Python programming, beginners often encounter an unexpected error when attempting to nest sets within sets:
`{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}` crashes immediately with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'`.

Why does this happen? Because sets are **mutable**, their contents can change at any moment, which means they cannot generate a stable hash code. To represent sets of sets, graphs, or use sets as dictionary keys, Python provides a specialized built-in companion data type: the **`frozenset`**.

## Real-World Analogy: Liquid Molten Wax vs Hardened Wax Stamp Seals

```

|                    FROZENSET REAL-WORLD ANALOGY                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  1. THE MOLTEN WAX BOWL (Standard Mutable Set):
     - In an artisan workshop in Jaipur, a bowl holds hot, molten wax.
     - You can drop in extra pigment (add), stir it, or pour some out (remove).
     - Because it is fluid and unstable, you cannot stamp an official royal
       seal onto its shifting surface!

  2. THE HARDENED WAX SEAL (Immutable frozenset):
     - Once the wax cools and hardens into a solid royal seal, it is FROZEN.
     - You can no longer add or remove wax from the seal.
     - Because it is rigid and permanent, you can safely pack multiple
       wax seals into a velvet gift box (a set of frozensets!).

  3. DICTIONARY KEYS & GRAPH NODES:
     - Just as an official certificate needs a permanent seal to be filed
       into an archive, Python dictionaries require a frozenset to index data!

## 1. The Hashability Conflict & The `frozenset()` Constructor

A `frozenset` is an immutable version of a Python set. Like tuples, once a `frozenset` is instantiated, its elements cannot be altered:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 1: Creating and Inspecting frozenset
# ==========================================================

# 1. Standard set mutation failure
try:
    bad_nested_set = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} }
except TypeError as err:
    print(f"Direct set nesting rejected: {err}")

# 2. Creating a frozenset
immutable_group_a = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
immutable_group_b = frozenset([3, 4, 5])

print(f"Group A: {immutable_group_a} (Type: {type(immutable_group_a).__name__})")

# 3. Nesting frozensets inside an outer set
valid_nested_set = {immutable_group_a, immutable_group_b}
print(f"Valid Nested Set: {valid_nested_set}")
print(f"Total Nested Elements: {len(valid_nested_set)}")
```

```text
Output:
Direct set nesting rejected: unhashable type: 'set'
Group A: frozenset({1, 2, 3}) (Type: frozenset)
Valid Nested Set: {frozenset({1, 2, 3}), frozenset({3, 4, 5})}
Total Nested Elements: 2
```

## 2. Using `frozenset` as a Dictionary Key

Because `frozenset` is hashable, it can serve as a key in a Python dictionary—a powerful pattern for routing graphs, joint permissions, or multi-user access rules:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 2: frozenset as Dictionary Keys
# ==========================================================

# Access permission lookup table mapped by sets of user roles:
permission_policy_cache = {
    frozenset({"developer", "tester"}): "Staging Environment Access",
    frozenset({"developer", "lead", "devops"}): "Production Deployment Access",
    frozenset({"intern"}): "Read-Only Sandbox Access"
}

# Lookup access for a team possessing a specific set of roles
current_team_roles = frozenset({"lead", "devops", "developer"})  # order does not matter!

if current_team_roles in permission_policy_cache:
    access_grant = permission_policy_cache[current_team_roles]
    print(f"Policy Decision: {access_grant}")
```

```text
Output:
Policy Decision: Production Deployment Access
```

## 3. Operations on `frozenset`

`frozenset` supports all non-mutating set operations (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetric_difference`, `issubset`):

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 3: Set Operations on frozenset
# ==========================================================

fs_alpha = frozenset(["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Kolkata"])
fs_beta = frozenset(["Mumbai", "Chennai", "Bengaluru"])

# 1. Union
fs_union = fs_alpha | fs_beta
print(f"frozenset Union:        {fs_union} (Type: {type(fs_union).__name__})")

# 2. Intersection
fs_overlap = fs_alpha & fs_beta
print(f"frozenset Intersection: {fs_overlap}")

# 3. Immutability Enforced
try:
    fs_alpha.add("Pune")
except AttributeError as err:
    print(f"Mutation rejected:      {err}")
```

```text
Output:
frozenset Union:        frozenset({'Bengaluru', 'Delhi', 'Chennai', 'Mumbai', 'Kolkata'}) (Type: frozenset)
frozenset Intersection: frozenset({'Mumbai'})
Mutation rejected:      'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

## 4. Mathematical Powerset Construction

A **powerset** is the set of all subsets of a given set, including the empty set and the set itself. In Python, powersets are represented as a set of `frozenset` objects:

```python
# ==========================================================
# Example 4: Generating a Mathematical Powerset
# ==========================================================

def generate_powerset(input_iterable):
    elements = list(input_iterable)
    power_set = {frozenset()}
    
    for item in elements:
        new_subsets = {subset | frozenset([item]) for subset in power_set}
        power_set |= new_subsets
        
    return power_set

base_set = {"A", "B", "C"}
result_powerset = generate_powerset(base_set)

print(f"Base Set: {base_set}")
print(f"Powerset size (2^3 = 8): {len(result_powerset)}")
for subset in sorted(result_powerset, key=len):
    print(f"  * {set(subset)}")
```

```text
Output:
Base Set: {'A', 'B', 'C'}
Powerset size (2^3 = 8): 8
  * set()
  * {'A'}
  * {'B'}
  * {'C'}
  * {'A', 'B'}
  * {'B', 'C'}
  * {'A', 'C'}
  * {'A', 'B', 'C'}
```

## Do's and Don'ts: Nested Sets & Frozenset

| Scenario | ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Pythonic Idiom |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nested Set Creation** | `s = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}` (TypeError) | `s = {frozenset({1, 2}), frozenset({3, 4})}` |
| **Set as Dict Key** | `d = { {1, 2}: "val" }` (TypeError) | `d = { frozenset({1, 2}): "val" }` |
| **Mutating Frozenset** | Calling `.add()` or `.discard()` | Use standard `set` if mutation is required |

## Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Why does Python raise `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'` when executing `{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}`?
A. Sets cannot contain integers
B. Standard sets are mutable, meaning their hash code is not constant, violating set element hashability requirements
C. Python only allows a maximum of 5 sets per file
D. Double curly braces are reserved only for string templates

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A set's elements must be hashable so their hash values can index into hash table buckets. Because standard sets are mutable, their contents can change, making them unhashable.

---

### 2. Which built-in Python data type represents an immutable, hashable set?
A. `constset`
B. `frozenset`
C. `staticset`
D. `tuple_set`

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Python provides `frozenset`, which is an immutable, hashable version of a set. Once created, its elements cannot be modified.

---

### 3. Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding `frozenset`?
A. A `frozenset` can be used as a dictionary key
B. A `frozenset` has an `.append()` method
C. A `frozenset` is ordered and can be indexed with `fs[0]`
D. A `frozenset` cannot perform union operations

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Because `frozenset` is immutable and hashable, it is fully eligible to serve as a key in Python dictionaries or as an element inside other sets.

---

### 4. What will `frozenset([1, 2]) | frozenset([2, 3])` evaluate to?
A. `frozenset({1, 2, 3})`
B. `{1, 2, 3}` as a mutable set
C. `TypeError`
D. `[1, 2, 3]`

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The union operator `|` on two frozensets returns a brand-new `frozenset` containing the merged elements: `frozenset({1, 2, 3})`.

---

### 5. What is the size of the mathematical powerset for a set with 4 elements?
A. 8
B. 12
C. 16
D. 4

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The cardinality of the powerset of any set with $n$ elements is $2^n$. For $n = 4$, $2^4 = 16$ distinct subsets exist.

## Hands-On Practice Challenge: Flight Route Consortium Alliance Validator

Build an airline alliance route validator (like Star Alliance) for Indian domestic flights. Airlines share code-share flight sectors represented as unordered pairs of airports. Use `frozenset` pairs (e.g. `frozenset({"DEL", "BOM"})`) to represent bidirectional routes. Store authorized alliance routes in a master set, verify whether a customer's multi-city journey segments are authorized, and calculate intersecting shared routes across airline partners.

### Starter Script & Complete Solution

```python
# ==========================================================
# Challenge: Airline Alliance Route Network Validator
# ==========================================================

# 1. Define bidirectional routes as immutable frozensets
# (Because route from DEL to BOM is identical to BOM to DEL!)
route_del_bom = frozenset({"DEL", "BOM"})
route_bom_blr = frozenset({"BOM", "BLR"})
route_del_blr = frozenset({"DEL", "BLR"})
route_del_ccu = frozenset({"DEL", "CCU"})

# 2. Master Alliance Network (A set containing frozensets)
star_alliance_india_network = {
    route_del_bom,
    route_bom_blr,
    route_del_blr,
    route_del_ccu
}

print("=== AIRLINE ALLIANCE ROUTE NETWORK ===")
print(f"Total Authorized Sectors: {len(star_alliance_india_network)}")

# 3. Passenger itinerary validation
passenger_booking_1 = frozenset({"BOM", "DEL"})  # Notice reverse order
passenger_booking_2 = frozenset({"DEL", "GOI"})  # Delhi to Goa (Not in alliance)

def validate_flight_sector(sector: frozenset) -> None:
    cities = list(sector)
    sector_str = f"{cities[0]} <---> {cities[1]}"
    if sector in star_alliance_india_network:
        print(f"[APPROVED] Sector {sector_str} is covered under Star Alliance.")
    else:
        print(f"[REJECTED] Sector {sector_str} is NOT an authorized alliance route.")

validate_flight_sector(passenger_booking_1)
validate_flight_sector(passenger_booking_2)

# 4. Shared partner code-share routes using frozenset intersection
indigo_sectors = {
    frozenset({"DEL", "BOM"}),
    frozenset({"BOM", "BLR"}),
    frozenset({"DEL", "HYD"})
}

shared_alliance_routes = star_alliance_india_network & indigo_sectors
print(f"\nShared Partner Routes Count: {len(shared_alliance_routes)}")
for route in shared_alliance_routes:
    ports = list(route)
    print(f"  * Code-Share Sector: {ports[0]} - {ports[1]}")
```

```text
Output:
=== AIRLINE ALLIANCE ROUTE NETWORK ===
Total Authorized Sectors: 4
[APPROVED] Sector DEL <---> BOM is covered under Star Alliance.
[REJECTED] Sector DEL <---> GOI is NOT an authorized alliance route.

Shared Partner Routes Count: 2
  * Code-Share Sector: DEL - BOM
  * Code-Share Sector: BOM - BLR
```
