# `async` and `await` Syntax

Formalized in PEP 492, the `async` and `await` keywords establish native asynchronous programming syntax in Python. By distinguishing coroutines from generator objects, native coroutines provide compile-time syntax validation, dedicated runtime protocols (`__await__`, `__aiter__`, `__aenter__`), and clear concurrency semantics.

---

## 1. Native Coroutines & The `await` Expression

Defining a function with `async def` creates a **Native Coroutine Function**. Calling this function **does not execute its body**; instead, it returns an unstarted **Coroutine Object**:

```python
async def fetch_user_profile(user_id: int) -> dict:
    print(f"Fetching user #{user_id}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return {"id": user_id, "name": "Ada Lovelace"}

# Calling the function without await:
coro = fetch_user_profile(42)
print("Type of coro:", type(coro))  # <class 'coroutine'>
# If left un-awaited, Python raises:
# RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'fetch_user_profile' was never awaited
```

### The Three Awaitable Objects
In Python, the `await` expression can only be used on objects that implement the **Awaitable Protocol** (defining an `__await__()` method). The three core awaitable types are:
1. **Coroutines**: Native coroutines created via `async def`.
2. **Tasks**: Coroutines scheduled onto the event loop via `asyncio.create_task()`.
3. **Futures**: Low-level objects representing the eventual result of an asynchronous operation (such as an I/O callback).

                        Implements __await__() method
```

## 2. Asynchronous Context Managers (`async with`)

Just as synchronous code manages resources with `with`, asynchronous code uses `async with` to acquire and release network connections, transactions, and session locks non-blockingly.

An asynchronous context manager implements two dunder methods:
- `__aenter__(self)`: A coroutine that returns the acquired resource.
- `__aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`: A coroutine that performs cleanup.

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Optional

class AsyncDatabaseSession:
    """Asynchronous context manager managing non-blocking database transactions."""

    def __init__(self, dsn: str) -> None:
        self.dsn = dsn
        self.is_connected = False

    async def __aenter__(self) -> "AsyncDatabaseSession":
        print(f"[DB] Opening asynchronous socket connection to {self.dsn}...")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulates async network handshake
        self.is_connected = True
        print("[DB] Connected successfully.")
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb) -> Optional[bool]:
        print("[DB] Closing asynchronous connection...")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)  # Simulates async TCP teardown
        self.is_connected = False
        print("[DB] Socket closed cleanly.")
        return None

async def execute_query():
    async with AsyncDatabaseSession("postgres://db.prod:5432/core") as session:
        print(f"Session active: {session.is_connected}")
        print("Executing non-blocking query...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(execute_query())
```

---

## 3. Asynchronous Iteration (`async for`)

Asynchronous iterators stream data non-blockingly (e.g. streaming chunks from an HTTP socket, WebSocket packets, or reading database query cursors).

They implement two methods:
- `__aiter__(self)`: Returns the asynchronous iterator object.
- `__anext__(self)`: A coroutine that returns the next value, or raises `StopAsyncIteration` when exhausted.

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDataStream:
    """Asynchronously yields simulated incoming telemetry chunks."""

    def __init__(self, total_packets: int) -> None:
        self.total_packets = total_packets
        self.current = 0

    def __aiter__(self) -> "AsyncDataStream":
        return self

    async def __anext__(self) -> dict:
        if self.current >= self.total_packets:
            raise StopAsyncIteration  # Signals end of async stream

        self.current += 1
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)  # Non-blocking pause for incoming packet
        return {"packet_index": self.current, "payload_bytes": 1024}

async def consume_stream():
    print("--- Reading Asynchronous Data Stream ---")
    async for packet in AsyncDataStream(total_packets=3):
        print(f"Received: Packet #{packet['packet_index']} ({packet['payload_bytes']} bytes)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(consume_stream())
```

---

## 4. Asynchronous Generators

Just as standard generators use `yield`, an `async def` function containing `yield` creates an **Asynchronous Generator**. It allows you to produce data streams lazily while using `await` internally:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncGenerator

async def fetch_paged_records(total_pages: int) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
    """Asynchronous generator yielding paginated network responses."""
    for page in range(1, total_pages + 1):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)  # Non-blocking API network request
        yield f"Page_{page}_Content"

async def process_pages():
    async for page_data in fetch_paged_records(4):
        print(f"Ingested: {page_data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(process_pages())
```

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
What occurs when an `async def` function is called directly without using the `await` keyword (e.g. `result = my_coroutine()`)?
A. The function executes immediately and returns its value.
B. A coroutine object is created and returned, but its body is NOT executed yet, triggering a `RuntimeWarning: coroutine was never awaited`.
C. A new OS thread is spawned.
D. A `SyntaxError` is raised.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Calling an `async def` function returns a coroutine object. Its code does not begin execution until it is explicitly awaited or scheduled as an `asyncio.Task` on an event loop.

---

### 2.
Which three types of objects are considered valid "Awaitables" that can follow the `await` keyword in Python?
A. Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples
B. Native Coroutines, Tasks, and Futures
C. Threads, Processes, and Sockets
D. Strings, Bytes, and Numbers

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The Python `asyncio` specification defines three primary awaitable objects: Coroutines (created by `async def`), Tasks (created via `asyncio.create_task`), and Futures (low-level callback trackers).

---

### 3.
Which dunder methods must a class implement to function as an asynchronous context manager with `async with`?
A. `__enter__` and `__exit__`
B. `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`
C. `__open__` and `__close__`
D. `__start__` and `__stop__`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Asynchronous context managers implement `__aenter__(self)` and `__aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`, both of which are coroutines evaluated with `await`.

---

### 4.
What exception must an asynchronous iterator raise from its `__anext__()` method to terminate an `async for` loop?
A. `StopIteration`
B. `StopAsyncIteration`
C. `GeneratorExit`
D. `EOFError`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** While synchronous iterators raise `StopIteration`, asynchronous iterators must raise `StopAsyncIteration` to signal that no further items remain in the stream.

---

### 5.
Where is the `await` expression permitted to appear in Python code?
A. Inside any standard Python function.
B. Exclusively inside functions defined with `async def` (or within the interactive REPL in Python 3.8+).
C. Only inside `__init__` methods.
D. Inside class definitions directly.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Using `await` outside of an `async def` function triggers a `SyntaxError: 'await' outside async function`.
