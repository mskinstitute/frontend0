# Advanced Generator Patterns

Generators are more than simple lazy iterators—they are stateful execution frames capable of suspension, resumption, bidirectional communication, and clean lifecycle management. Under the hood, Python generators pause their execution context, retaining local variables, instruction pointers, and exception states on the CPython heap.

Understanding the internal state machine of generators unlocks advanced data streaming architectures, pipeline composition, and cooperative concurrency patterns.

## 1. The Generator State Machine

At any given moment during runtime, a Python generator resides in one of four distinct states defined in the `inspect` module:

```
                            GEN_CREATED
                          (Instantiated)
                                │
                        first next() or send(None)
                                │
                                ▼
         ┌───────────────► GEN_RUNNING ◄───────────────┐
         │                (Executing)                  │
         │                      │                      │
   next() / send()              │ yield                │ next() / send()
         │                      ▼                      │
         └───────────── GEN_SUSPENDED ─────────────────┘
                          (Paused at yield)
                                │
                     return / exception / close()
                                │
                                ▼
                            GEN_CLOSED
                           (Terminated)
```

| State | Constant | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Created** | `GEN_CREATED` | Waiting to start execution; no `next()` or `send()` has been called yet. |
| **Running** | `GEN_RUNNING` | Currently being executed by the interpreter. |
| **Suspended** | `GEN_SUSPENDED` | Paused at a `yield` expression; frame preserved in memory. |
| **Closed** | `GEN_CLOSED` | Execution finished (via return, unhandled exception, or `.close()`). |

```python
import inspect

def stateful_sequence():
    print("  -> Execution started inside generator")
    yield 1
    print("  -> Execution resumed after first yield")
    yield 2
    print("  -> Execution finished")

gen = stateful_sequence()
print("Initial state:    ", inspect.getgeneratorstate(gen))  # GEN_CREATED

val1 = next(gen)
print("After first next: ", inspect.getgeneratorstate(gen))  # GEN_SUSPENDED

val2 = next(gen)
print("After second next:", inspect.getgeneratorstate(gen))  # GEN_SUSPENDED

try:
    next(gen)
except StopIteration:
    print("Exhausted:        ", inspect.getgeneratorstate(gen))  # GEN_CLOSED
```

---

## 2. Generator Frame Mechanics and Memory

When a regular function finishes, its stack frame is deallocated. In contrast, when a generator yields, CPython marks the frame as suspended and preserves its local variable array and instruction pointer (`f_lasti`) on the heap:

```python
def accumulator():
    total = 0
    while True:
        value = yield total
        if value is None:
            break
        total += value

acc = accumulator()
next(acc)  # Prime generator

# Inspect the generator's underlying frame
frame = acc.gi_frame
print("Instruction pointer (f_lasti):", frame.f_lasti)
print("Local variables in frame:     ", frame.f_locals)  # {'total': 0}
```

---

## 3. Clean Termination with `.close()` and `GeneratorExit`

When a generator is closed explicitly via `gen.close()`, or when it is garbage collected, CPython raises a `GeneratorExit` exception at the current `yield` point.

> **Critical Rule:** When catching `GeneratorExit`, cleanup logic in `finally` blocks must execute cleanly. The generator **must not yield any additional values**; attempting to yield during `GeneratorExit` triggers a fatal `RuntimeError: generator ignored GeneratorExit`.

```python
def monitored_resource_stream(resource_name: str):
    print(f"[INIT] Allocating resource: {resource_name}")
    try:
        count = 0
        while True:
            yield f"{resource_name}_data_{count}"
            count += 1
    except GeneratorExit:
        print(f"[CLEANUP] Gracefully releasing resource: {resource_name}")
        # Note: Do NOT yield here!
    finally:
        print("[AUDIT] Finalizer executed.")

stream = monitored_resource_stream("DatabaseCursor")
print(next(stream))
print(next(stream))

# Premature termination before exhaustion
print("Closing generator early...")
stream.close()
print("Generator closed successfully.")
```

---

## 4. Composing Multi-Stage Generator Pipelines

The most scalable pattern for processing unbounded data streams is the **Pipeline Pattern**. Each stage is an independent generator that accepts an input iterable and yields transformed items:

```
 Data Source ──► [Filter Stage] ──► [Transform Stage] ──► [Batch Stage] ──► Consumer
(Infinite/File)   (Drops Noise)      (Enriches Data)       (Bundles 5)       (Writes)
```

```python
from typing import Generator, Iterable, Iterator

# Stage 1: Data Producer
def raw_event_source(total: int) -> Generator[dict, None, None]:
    for i in range(total):
        yield {"id": i, "status": "FAIL" if i % 4 == 0 else "OK", "val": i * 10}

# Stage 2: Filter Stage (discards OK events)
def failure_filter(events: Iterable[dict]) -> Iterator[dict]:
    for event in events:
        if event["status"] == "FAIL":
            yield event

# Stage 3: Transformation Stage (enriches data)
def alert_enricher(events: Iterable[dict]) -> Iterator[dict]:
    for event in events:
        event["severity"] = "CRITICAL" if event["val"] > 50 else "WARNING"
        yield event

# Assembling the pipeline (Zero items processed yet - fully lazy!)
source = raw_event_source(20)
filtered = failure_filter(source)
enriched_pipeline = alert_enricher(filtered)

# Consumption Stage: Pulling from pipeline
print("--- Pulling Alerts from Pipeline ---")
for alert in enriched_pipeline:
    print(f"Alert ID: {alert['id']} | Severity: {alert['severity']} | Value: {alert['val']}")
```

## 5. Architectural Summary Table

| Lifecycle Event | Action | Next State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `gen = my_func()` | Generator instantiation | `GEN_CREATED` |
| `next(gen)` / `gen.send(None)` | Advances to next `yield` | `GEN_SUSPENDED` |
| `gen.close()` | Raises `GeneratorExit` inside frame | `GEN_CLOSED` |
| `gen.throw(exc)` | Injects exception at suspension point | Handled: `GEN_SUSPENDED` / Unhandled: `GEN_CLOSED` |
| Reaching `return` / end | Raises `StopIteration` | `GEN_CLOSED` |

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
What is the state of a freshly instantiated generator object before `next()` or `send()` has been invoked on it?
A. `GEN_RUNNING`
B. `GEN_SUSPENDED`
C. `GEN_CREATED`
D. `GEN_PENDING`

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** An instantiated generator remains in the `GEN_CREATED` state until execution is primed by calling `next()` or `send(None)`.

---

### 2.
What exception is raised inside a suspended generator when `gen.close()` is called?
A. `StopIteration`
B. `GeneratorExit`
C. `KeyboardInterrupt`
D. `SystemExit`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Python raises a `GeneratorExit` exception at the suspension point to allow the generator's `finally` or `except GeneratorExit` blocks to execute resource cleanup.

---

### 3.
What occurs if a generator catches `GeneratorExit` and attempts to yield another value with `yield`?
A. The value is successfully emitted to the caller.
B. Python ignores the yield and terminates silently.
C. Python raises a `RuntimeError: generator ignored GeneratorExit`.
D. A `StopIteration` exception is raised.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Generators are forbidden from yielding values during handling of `GeneratorExit`. Violating this triggers a `RuntimeError: generator ignored GeneratorExit`.

---

### 4.
Where does CPython store the local variables and execution instruction pointer of a suspended generator?
A. In CPU register cache $L1$.
B. In an active heap-allocated frame object (`gi_frame`).
C. On the operating system thread execution stack.
D. In a temporary file on disk.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Suspended generators store their local execution environment on the heap within a Python frame object (`gi_frame`), allowing them to resume execution safely across function calls.

---

### 5.
What is the primary operational characteristic of a generator pipeline where multiple generator functions are chained together?
A. Each stage runs on a separate CPU core via multiprocessing.
B. All data is eagerly transformed into memory before the next stage runs.
C. Data flows lazily item-by-item through each stage on demand when the final consumer calls `next()`.
D. The entire pipeline is converted to SQL queries.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Generator pipelines operate via demand-driven pull: the consumer requests one item, which causes each stage in the chain to execute just enough to produce that single item, requiring minimal memory.
