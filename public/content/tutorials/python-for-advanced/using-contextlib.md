# Using `contextlib`

The Python standard library's `contextlib` module provides high-level utilities and decorators that drastically simplify context management. Instead of authoring boilerplate classes with explicit `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, you can construct robust context managers using simple generator functions, dynamically manage arbitrary numbers of resources, and redirect I/O streams.

---

## 1. The `@contextlib.contextmanager` Decorator

The `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator converts a simple Python generator into a fully compliant context manager.

```
                  Generator Execution with @contextmanager
                                     │
                      with my_context() as value:
                                     │
                                     ▼
                1. Executes generator up to the yield statement
                   (Setup Phase / __enter__)
                                     │
                                     ▼
                2. Yields value to the caller (bound to 'as value')
                                     │
                                     ▼
                3. Executes the body of the with block
                                     │
                                     ▼
                4. Generator resumes immediately after yield
                   inside a try...finally block (Cleanup Phase / __exit__)
```

### The Standard Pattern: `try...finally`

> **Rule:** Any code following `yield` must be enclosed in a `try...finally` block. If an exception occurs inside the user's `with` block, Python re-raises that exception inside the generator at the point of `yield`. Without `finally`, cleanup logic will be skipped.

```python
import contextlib
import time
from typing import Generator

@contextlib.contextmanager
def benchmark_timer(task_name: str) -> Generator[dict, None, None]:
    """Measures and logs elapsed execution time using a generator context manager."""
    metrics = {"start": time.perf_counter(), "elapsed_ms": 0.0}
    print(f"[START] Beginning task: {task_name}")
    try:
        # yield value is passed to the 'as' variable
        yield metrics
    finally:
        metrics["elapsed_ms"] = (time.perf_counter() - metrics["start"]) * 1000
        print(f"[FINISH] {task_name} finished in {metrics['elapsed_ms']:.2f} ms")

# Usage
with benchmark_timer("Image Processing Pipeline") as telemetry:
    time.sleep(0.02)  # Simulate workload

print(f"Recorded telemetry in outer scope: {telemetry['elapsed_ms']:.2f} ms")
```

---

## 2. Handling Exceptions Inside `@contextmanager`

To catch, handle, or suppress exceptions occurring in the `with` block, wrap the `yield` statement in a `try...except` block:

```python
@contextlib.contextmanager
def catch_and_log(target_exception: type[Exception]):
    """Catches a specific exception type and logs it without crashing."""
    try:
        yield
    except target_exception as exc:
        print(f"[SUPPRESSED] Caught expected error: {exc}")
    finally:
        print("[CLEANUP] Routine cleanup guaranteed.")

with catch_and_log(KeyError):
    d = {"name": "Alice"}
    print(d["missing_key"])  # Raises KeyError

print("Program continued past suppressed error.")
```

---

## 3. Essential `contextlib` Utilities

Python's `contextlib` module includes several indispensable pre-built utilities:

### `contextlib.suppress(*exceptions)`
Replaces verbose `try...except pass` blocks with clean, self-documenting code:

```python
import os

# Instead of:
# try:
#     os.remove("temp_cache.tmp")
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     pass

# Idiomatic approach:
with contextlib.suppress(FileNotFoundError):
    os.remove("temp_cache.tmp")
```

### `contextlib.redirect_stdout` and `redirect_stderr`
Temporarily redirects standard output or error streams to an in-memory buffer:

```python
import io

buffer = io.StringIO()
with contextlib.redirect_stdout(buffer):
    print("This message is captured, not printed to terminal.")
    print("Second line of telemetry.")

captured_text = buffer.getvalue()
print(f"Captured {len(captured_text)} characters successfully!")
```

### `contextlib.closing(obj)`
Adapts third-party objects that provide a `.close()` method (such as legacy database connections or network sockets) to work seamlessly with the `with` statement:

```python
class LegacySocket:
    def close(self) -> None:
        print("Legacy socket successfully closed.")

with contextlib.closing(LegacySocket()) as sock:
    print("Using legacy socket within context manager.")
```

### `contextlib.nullcontext(enter_result=None)`
Provides a no-op context manager, useful when a context manager is conditionally optional:

```python
def process_data(lock=None):
    # If lock is None, use nullcontext() so syntax remains identical
    context = lock if lock is not None else contextlib.nullcontext()
    with context:
        print("Safely executing protected logic.")
```

## 4. Dynamic Context Management with `contextlib.ExitStack`

When the number of files or resources is not known at compile time (e.g. opening an arbitrary list of file paths from user input), static `with open(...) as f1, open(...) as f2:` statements are impossible. `ExitStack` programmatically coordinates an arbitrary number of context managers in a clean LIFO stack:

```python
@contextlib.contextmanager
def open_dummy_resource(name: str):
    print(f"Acquiring {name}")
    try:
        yield name
    finally:
        print(f"Releasing {name}")

resource_names = ["DB_Connection", "Kafka_Producer", "Redis_Cache"]

with contextlib.ExitStack() as stack:
    active_resources = [
        stack.enter_context(open_dummy_resource(name))
        for name in resource_names
    ]
    print("All resources acquired:", active_resources)
    # If any error occurs here, all entered contexts are cleaned up in reverse order
```

| Tool | Primary Purpose | Common Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@contextlib.contextmanager` | Generator-based context manager | Rapid creation of custom setup/teardown logic |
| `contextlib.suppress(*exc)` | Exception silencing | Ignoring non-critical errors (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`) |
| `contextlib.redirect_stdout` | Stream interception | Capturing CLI output for testing or logging |
| `contextlib.closing(obj)` | Adapter for `.close()` methods | Legacy objects lacking native context protocol |
| `contextlib.ExitStack` | Dynamic context nesting | Opening a runtime-determined list of files or resources |
| `contextlib.nullcontext` | Conditional / dummy context | Branching code where resource management is optional |

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
How does the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator identify the value that should be passed to the variable in the `as` clause?
A. The value returned by `return`
B. The value yielded by `yield`
C. The first argument passed to the generator
D. The generator's `__name__`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** In a `@contextlib.contextmanager` generator function, the single `yield <value>` expression determines the object bound to the `as` target in the `with` statement.

---

### 2.
Why is it essential to place the `yield` statement inside a `try...finally` block in a `@contextlib.contextmanager` function?
A. Python requires `try...finally` syntax in every generator.
B. If an exception occurs inside the user's `with` block, it is raised at the `yield` point; without `finally`, subsequent cleanup code will not execute.
C. It prevents the generator from yielding more than once.
D. It increases CPython bytecode compilation speed.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** When an unhandled exception occurs within the `with` body, Python re-injects that exception into the generator at the `yield` statement. A `finally` block ensures that cleanup code executes regardless of whether an exception was raised.

---

### 3.
What does `contextlib.suppress(FileNotFoundError)` do when a `FileNotFoundError` occurs within its `with` block?
A. Logs the full traceback to `sys.stderr` and exits the process.
B. Swallows the `FileNotFoundError` cleanly, allowing execution to continue after the block.
C. Converts the error into a `RuntimeError`.
D. Re-raises the error after a 5-second delay.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `contextlib.suppress(*exceptions)` silences any of the specified exception types if they are raised inside the `with` block, acting as an idiomatic replacement for `try...except: pass`.

---

### 4.
Which `contextlib` class allows managing an arbitrary, dynamically determined collection of context managers simultaneously?
A. `contextlib.DynamicManager`
B. `contextlib.ExitStack`
C. `contextlib.MultiContext`
D. `contextlib.ResourceList`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `contextlib.ExitStack` maintains a stack of context managers and cleanup callbacks entered programmatically at runtime, unwinding them safely in LIFO (reverse) order upon exit.

---

### 5.
When would a developer choose `contextlib.nullcontext()` over a real context manager?
A. When writing unit tests where resource acquisition should be mocked or bypassed conditionally.
B. When multi-threading is disabled in the Python runtime.
C. When opening binary files.
D. To suppress all syntax errors.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** `contextlib.nullcontext(enter_result)` is a no-op context manager that simply returns its argument upon enter and does nothing upon exit. It is ideal when a context manager is optional or dynamically provided.
