# Project: Multithreaded Downloader

Network asset acquisition—such as downloading high-resolution images, video segments, dataset shards, or API payloads—is fundamentally bound by network latency rather than CPU throughput. Executing downloads sequentially wastes bandwidth and stalls execution.

In this project, we will construct a production-ready **Concurrent Multithreaded File Downloader**. It leverages a thread-safe Producer-Consumer queue architecture, coordinated worker threads, synchronized progress telemetry, and graceful cancellation support.

## 1. Downloader Architecture

The system utilizes the **Thread-Safe Work Queue Pattern**:

```
 [Download URL Tasks]
          │
          ▼
   queue.Queue (FIFO)
  (Thread-Safe Buffer)
          │
          ├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
          ▼                       ▼                       ▼
    Worker Thread 1         Worker Thread 2         Worker Thread 3
   (Acquires Semaphore)    (Acquires Semaphore)    (Acquires Semaphore)
          │                       │                       │
          ▼                       ▼                       ▼
   Fetch Asset Chunk       Fetch Asset Chunk       Fetch Asset Chunk
          │                       │                       │
          └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                  ▼
                     [Shared Telemetry Mutex]
                    (Updates Download Progress)
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    queue.task_done() / All Done!
```

## 3. Verification & Execution

```python
def main():
    print("=====================================================")
    print("     TESTING HIGH-CONCURRENCY MULTITHREADED DOWNLOADER")
    print("=====================================================")

    output_directory = "downloaded_assets_test"
    downloader = ConcurrentDownloader(num_workers=4, max_simultaneous_sockets=2)
    downloader.start()

    # Generate synthetic download jobs
    jobs = [

## 4. Key Architectural Patterns

1. **`queue.Queue` Thread Safety**: CPython's standard `queue.Queue` implements all necessary internal mutexes and condition variables, ensuring that concurrent `get()` and `put()` operations are strictly atomic without manual locking.
2. **Sentinel / Poison Pill Pattern**: Sending `None` into the queue informs workers that no further tasks will arrive, allowing them to terminate cleanly.
3. **Double Synchronization**:
   - `queue.task_done()`: Decrements the queue's unfinished task counter.
   - `queue.join()`: Blocks until every submitted job has called `task_done()`.

---

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
Why is `queue.Queue` preferred over a standard Python `list` for coordinating work between producer and consumer threads?
A. `queue.Queue` automatically saves tasks to disk.
B. `queue.Queue` provides built-in thread safety with atomic locking and condition variables, eliminating race conditions during task retrieval.
C. `list` cannot store dictionaries or objects.
D. `queue.Queue` disables the GIL.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Standard Python lists are not thread-safe for coordinated concurrent producer-consumer pipelines. `queue.Queue` provides internal synchronization, atomic `put()` and `get()` operations, and blocking wait mechanisms.

---

### 2.
What happens when `downloader.work_queue.join()` is called?
A. All threads are killed immediately.
B. The calling thread blocks until every item added to the queue has had a corresponding `task_done()` called.
C. The queue is cleared of all items.
D. The process exits with code 0.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `queue.join()` blocks until the queue's internal unfinished task counter drops to zero, which happens when workers call `task_done()` for every processed item.

---

### 3.
What role does `threading.Semaphore(max_simultaneous_sockets)` play in the downloader?
A. It calculates the file hash.
B. It restricts the maximum number of concurrent active network connections, preventing socket exhaustion or server rate-limiting bans.
C. It sorts the download queue by file size.
D. It generates random URLs.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** By wrapping the download execution inside `with self.semaphore:`, only up to $N$ worker threads can hold active network connections simultaneously, throttling resource utilization.

---

### 4.
What is the "poison pill" or sentinel pattern in queue-based multithreading?
A. Sending an invalid URL to test error handling.
B. Putting a unique sentinel value (such as `None`) into the queue to signal workers that they should exit their processing loop.
C. An operating system interrupt signal.
D. A memory leak caused by unreleased threads.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** A poison pill is a recognized sentinel object placed into the queue that signals consumer worker threads to terminate their loop and exit gracefully.

---

### 5.
Why must `self.telemetry` methods acquire a `threading.Lock` before modifying `self.total_completed` and `self.total_bytes_kb`?
A. Otherwise, CPython raises a `SyntaxError`.
B. To prevent race conditions where multiple worker threads simultaneously modify shared integers, resulting in lost updates.
C. Because telemetry files require administrator privileges.
D. To prevent the threads from using too much CPU.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Because multiple worker threads complete downloads at roughly the same time, updating shared numeric counters without a lock leads to concurrent write collisions (race conditions).
