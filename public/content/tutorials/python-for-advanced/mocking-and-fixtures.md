# Mocking and Fixtures with `unittest.mock`

When testing complex software systems, isolating the unit under test from slow, non-deterministic, or hazardous external dependencies—such as third-party payment gateways, remote REST APIs, email servers, or physical disks—is a fundamental testing requirement.

In Python, the `unittest.mock` module provides a powerful mocking framework. Mastering `Mock`, `MagicMock`, and the `@patch` decorator allows you to simulate external behaviors, verify method call contracts, and avoid flaky tests.

## 1. `Mock` vs `MagicMock`

Both `Mock` and `MagicMock` dynamically generate attributes and methods upon access. Any accessed attribute returns a new Mock instance, recording how it was invoked:

```

                                       │
        ┌──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┐
        ▼                                                             ▼
  Standard Mock                                                  MagicMock
- Generic method calls                                         - Inherits from Mock
- Records call_count, args, kwargs                             - Pre-populates all Python
                                                                 Dunder Methods:
                                                                 __iter__, __len__,
                                                                 __enter__, __exit__,
                                                                 __getitem__, __str__
```

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, Mock

# 1. Standard Mock for generic function calls
service_mock = Mock()
service_mock.process_payment.return_value = {"status": "SUCCESS", "tx_id": "tx_9921"}

# Execute mock
response = service_mock.process_payment(amount=150.0, currency="USD")
print("Mock Response:", response)

# Verify invocation assertions
service_mock.process_payment.assert_called_once_with(amount=150.0, currency="USD")
print(f"Recorded calls count: {service_mock.process_payment.call_count}")

# 2. MagicMock for context managers and protocols
context_mock = MagicMock()
with context_mock as ctx:
    print("Inside MagicMock context manager block!")

# MagicMock automatically implements and records __enter__ and __exit__
context_mock.__enter__.assert_called_once()
context_mock.__exit__.assert_called_once()
```

---

## 2. Dynamic Returns & Errors via `side_effect`

While `return_value` returns a static value, `side_effect` allows dynamic behavior:
1. **Raising Exceptions**: Simulates network timeouts or HTTP 500 crashes.
2. **Sequential Returns**: Returns different values on successive calls by providing an iterable.
3. **Dynamic Callables**: Routes calls through a custom calculation function.

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Scenario A: Simulating network failure
network_mock = Mock(side_effect=ConnectionResetError("Socket aborted by remote server"))
try:
    network_mock()
except ConnectionResetError as err:
    print(f"[RECOVERY] Caught simulated error: {err}")

# Scenario B: Sequential mock returns
counter_mock = Mock(side_effect=[10, 20, 30])
print(counter_mock())  # 10
print(counter_mock())  # 20
print(counter_mock())  # 30
```

---

## 3. The Golden Rule of Patching: Where to Patch

The `@patch` decorator replaces a target object with a Mock during test execution and automatically restores the original object upon completion.

> **The Golden Rule of Patching:** **Patch where an object is LOOKED UP, not where it is DEFINED.**

```
 If file 'service.py' does:
 from payment_lib import ChargeCard
 
 ──► WRONG: @patch("payment_lib.ChargeCard")
     (service.py already imported its own local reference to ChargeCard!)
 
 ──► CORRECT: @patch("service.ChargeCard")
     (Patches the reference where service.py looks it up!)
```

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

# Component under test
class EmailNotifier:
    def send_welcome(self, email: str) -> bool:
        # Calls external system function
        import smtplib  # Simulated lookup
        server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.internal.net")
        server.sendmail("noreply@app.com", [email], "Welcome aboard!")
        server.quit()
        return True

class TestEmailNotifier(unittest.TestCase):
    # Patch the smtplib.SMTP constructor where it is imported/looked up
    @patch("smtplib.SMTP")
    def test_send_welcome_success(self, mock_smtp_class: MagicMock) -> None:
        # Configure instance returned by constructor
        mock_server_instance = mock_smtp_class.return_value

        notifier = EmailNotifier()
        result = notifier.send_welcome("dev@example.org")

        self.assertTrue(result)
        # Verify smtplib.SMTP was called with correct host
        mock_smtp_class.assert_called_once_with("smtp.internal.net")
        # Verify email dispatch was triggered
        mock_server_instance.sendmail.assert_called_once_with(
            "noreply@app.com",
            ["dev@example.org"],
            "Welcome aboard!"
        )
        mock_server_instance.quit.assert_called_once()
```

## 4. Combining Pytest Fixtures with Mocks

In modern testing architectures, combine Pytest fixtures with `unittest.mock.patch` to create clean, modular mocked dependencies:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, payment_gateway):
        self.gateway = payment_gateway

    def place_order(self, amount: float) -> str:
        res = self.gateway.charge(amount)
        if not res.get("success"):
            raise RuntimeError("Payment rejected")
        return res["transaction_id"]

@pytest.fixture
def mock_gateway() -> MagicMock:
    """Fixture providing a pre-configured payment gateway mock."""
    gateway = MagicMock()
    gateway.charge.return_value = {"success": True, "transaction_id": "TXN_7749"}
    return gateway

def test_order_placement_success(mock_gateway: MagicMock):
    service = OrderService(payment_gateway=mock_gateway)
    txn_id = service.place_order(99.99)
    
    assert txn_id == "TXN_7749"
    mock_gateway.charge.assert_called_once_with(99.99)
```

## 5. Architectural Summary Table

| Tool | Primary Purpose | Key Attribute / Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Mock` | Lightweight object proxy | `return_value`, `side_effect`, `call_count` |
| `MagicMock` | Subclass implementing dunders | Supports `with`, `len()`, `iter()`, `str()` |
| `@patch(target)` | Replaces object during test | Target must be where name is looked up |
| `patch.object(cls, 'attr')` | Replaces specific attribute on class | Safer than string path when object is in scope |
| `assert_called_with(*args)` | Verifies call parameters | Fails if arguments mismatch |

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
What is the primary operational difference between `Mock` and `MagicMock` in Python's `unittest.mock` library?
A. `MagicMock` runs twice as fast as `Mock`.
B. `MagicMock` comes pre-configured with default implementations for all standard Python magic/dunder methods (such as `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `__len__`, `__iter__`), whereas `Mock` does not.
C. `Mock` is deprecated in Python 3.
D. `MagicMock` automatically commits database transactions.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `MagicMock` is a subclass of `Mock` that implements Python's special dunder methods, allowing it to mimic containers, context managers, and iterables without manual setup.

---

### 2.
What is the "Golden Rule of Patching" when using `unittest.mock.patch`?
A. Patch where the object is defined.
B. Patch where the object is looked up / used, not where it was originally defined.
C. Always patch built-in functions first.
D. Only patch classes in the standard library.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** If module `A` imports `from B import C`, patching `B.C` has no effect on module `A` because `A` already holds its own reference. You must patch `A.C`.

---

### 3.
How can you configure a `Mock` object to raise a `TimeoutError` when called?
A. `my_mock.raise = TimeoutError`
B. `my_mock.side_effect = TimeoutError("Connection timed out")`
C. `my_mock.return_value = TimeoutError`
D. `my_mock.error = True`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Setting `side_effect` to an exception class or instance instructs the mock to raise that exception whenever it is called.

---

### 4.
What does `my_mock.assert_called_once_with("admin", port=8080)` verify?
A. That the mock was called at least 5 times.
B. That the mock was called exactly once in total, and that its arguments during that single invocation strictly matched `("admin", port=8080)`.
C. That the function returned `True`.
D. That the network socket opened successfully.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `assert_called_once_with` asserts both that the total invocation count equals 1 and that the arguments passed match the expected positional and keyword values.

---

### 5.
What happens to a patched object after a test decorated with `@patch('module.Class')` completes execution?
A. The object remains permanently replaced by the mock.
B. The patch automatically exits and restores the original un-mocked class reference in the target namespace.
C. Python restarts the process.
D. The module is deleted.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `patch` acts as a context manager or function wrapper that guarantees the target namespace is cleanly un-patched and restored to its original state once the test exits.
