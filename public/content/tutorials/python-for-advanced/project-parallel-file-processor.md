# Project: Parallel File Processor

Processing large volumes of log files, sensor records, or text corpora sequentially introduces severe operational bottlenecks. Because parsing, regular expression extraction, and cryptographic hashing are CPU-bound, multithreading cannot achieve multi-core speedups due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

In this project, we will construct a production-ready **Parallel File & Document Processing Engine** using a MapReduce architecture. It distributes chunks of files across multiple CPU cores, aggregates token metrics in parallel, and merges partial results into a unified analytical summary.

## 1. Engine Architecture

The Parallel Processor uses a **Master-Worker MapReduce Pipeline**:

## 3. Verification & Execution Benchmark

## 4. Key Architectural Insights

1. **Pure Functions for Worker Tasks**: `process_single_file` does not reference global mutable state. It accepts a file path string and returns a picklable `FileProcessingResult` tuple, ensuring seamless IPC serialization.
2. **`as_completed` Processing**: Rather than waiting for the entire batch to finish, results are streamed back as soon as any worker completes, improving perceived throughput.
3. **MapReduce Pattern**: Workers independently execute the "Map" phase (file parsing and tokenization), while the supervisor executes the "Reduce" phase (`global_word_frequencies.update(result.word_frequencies)`).

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
Why is `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` preferred over manual `multiprocessing.Process` instantiation for large batch jobs?
A. `ProcessPoolExecutor` automatically reuses worker processes, handles task queues, captures return values via `Future` objects, and cleans up process pools via context managers.
B. `ProcessPoolExecutor` disables Python's type checking.
C. `ProcessPoolExecutor` runs in browser web workers.
D. `multiprocessing.Process` does not support file reading.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** `ProcessPoolExecutor` abstracts low-level process management by maintaining a reusable pool of workers, queuing tasks, and returning `Future` objects for result retrieval and error handling.

---

### 2.
What role does `concurrent.futures.as_completed()` play in parallel execution?
A. It terminates all workers that take longer than 1 second.
B. It returns an iterator yielding `Future` instances as they finish, allowing results to be processed incrementally as soon as they become available.
C. It sorts files by creation date.
D. It guarantees that tasks finish in the exact order they were submitted.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `as_completed()` yields completed futures immediately as each worker finishes its computation, avoiding unnecessary delays from waiting on slower tasks.

---

### 3.
What requirement must be met by functions passed to worker processes in `ProcessPoolExecutor`?
A. They must be written in C++.
B. The function, its arguments, and its return values must be serializable via Python's `pickle` module.
C. They must not use loops.
D. They must accept only integer arguments.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** In multiprocessing, data crosses process boundaries through IPC pipes, which relies on the `pickle` protocol to serialize functions, arguments, and return values.

---

### 4.
In the MapReduce pattern implemented in this project, which step constitutes the "Reduce" phase?
A. Reading lines from the file on disk.
B. Merging the partial `Counter` dictionaries returned by workers into the `global_word_frequencies` counter.
C. Hashing bytes with SHA-256.
D. Spawning worker processes.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The "Reduce" phase aggregates, summarizes, or merges the independent partial results produced by the parallel workers ("Map" phase) into a final unified result.

---

### 5.
What happens if an unhandled exception occurs inside `process_single_file` during worker execution?
A. The entire Python program crashes immediately.
B. The exception is captured and re-raised when the parent process calls `future.result()`.
C. The worker is hung in memory forever.
D. The exception is silently suppressed.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `concurrent.futures` catches exceptions occurring in worker processes, storing them in the corresponding `Future` object and re-raising them when `.result()` is invoked by the caller.
