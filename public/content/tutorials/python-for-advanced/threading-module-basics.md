# Threading Module Basics

Concurrency is the composition of independently executing computations. In Python, the `threading` module provides high-level primitives for creating and managing native operating system threads. Understanding how Python threads interact with system hardware and the CPython runtime is essential for designing high-performance, responsive applications.

## 1. Operating System Threads & The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

In CPython (the standard Python reference implementation), a `threading.Thread` object corresponds to a real, native operating system thread (e.g. a POSIX thread on Linux/macOS or a Win32 thread on Windows).

However, CPython relies on the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**—a mutual exclusion mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously on separate CPU cores:

```
                            CPU Core 1               CPU Core 2
                                │                        │
                    ┌───────────┴───────────┐            │
                    │   Acquires GIL Mutex   │            │
                    │   Thread A (Executing) │            │
                    └───────────┬───────────┘            │
                                │ Releases GIL           │
                                ▼                        │
                    ┌───────────────────────┐            │
                    │   Acquires GIL Mutex   │            │
                    │   Thread B (Executing) │            │
                    └───────────────────────┘            ▼
                                                    Thread Idle /
                                                 Waiting for GIL Lock
```

### When to Use Threads in Python
- **I/O-Bound Workloads (Threads Excel)**: Network requests, database queries, file reads/writes, socket streaming. When a thread initiates I/O, it **releases the GIL**, allowing other threads to run concurrently while the first waits for the operating system or network.
- **CPU-Bound Workloads (Threads Underperform)**: Mathematical matrix operations, video encoding, cryptography, image transformations. Multiple threads competing for the GIL add context-switching overhead without utilizing multi-core parallelism. (Use `multiprocessing` instead).

## 2. Spawning Threads: Target Callables vs Subclassing

Python supports two distinct architectural patterns for thread instantiation:

### Pattern A: Passing a Target Callable
The most common approach: passing a target function and its arguments to `threading.Thread`:

```python
import threading
import time

def worker_task(task_id: int, duration: float) -> None:
    thread_name = threading.current_thread().name
    print(f"[{thread_name}] Starting task #{task_id} (will take {duration}s)...")
    time.sleep(duration)  # Simulates I/O wait; GIL is released
    print(f"[{thread_name}] Completed task #{task_id}.")

# Spawning threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=worker_task, args=(1, 0.5), name="WorkerThread-Alpha")
t2 = threading.Thread(target=worker_task, args=(2, 0.3), name="WorkerThread-Beta")

t1.start()
t2.start()

# Wait for both threads to finish
t1.join()
t2.join()

print("All worker tasks finished.")
```

### Pattern B: Subclassing `threading.Thread`
Ideal for encapsulating thread-specific state, telemetry, or custom lifecycle hooks:

```python
class HeartbeatMonitor(threading.Thread):
    """Encapsulates a dedicated background health monitoring thread."""

    def __init__(self, host: str, interval: float) -> None:
        super().__init__(name=f"Monitor-{host}")
        self.host = host
        self.interval = interval
        self._is_active = True

    def run(self) -> None:
        """The entry point executed when thread.start() is invoked."""
        print(f"[{self.name}] Monitoring initiated for {self.host}")
        while self._is_active:
            # Simulate network ping
            time.sleep(self.interval)
            print(f"[{self.name}] Ping sent to {self.host} -> OK")

    def stop(self) -> None:
        self._is_active = False

# Usage
monitor = HeartbeatMonitor("192.168.1.1", interval=0.2)
monitor.start()
time.sleep(0.5)
monitor.stop()
monitor.join()
print("Heartbeat monitoring terminated.")
```

## 3. Thread Synchronization with `join()`

The `join([timeout])` method blocks the calling thread (usually the main thread) until the target thread terminates or the optional timeout expires:

```
 Main Thread ───────► t1.start() ────► t1.join() (Blocked) ──────────► Resumes
                          │                     ▲
                          ▼                     │
 Worker Thread (t1)   Starts Execution ──► Work Finished ──► Exits
```

```python
threads = []
for i in range(3):
    t = threading.Thread(target=time.sleep, args=(0.1,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Verify thread vitality
for t in threads:
    print(f"Thread {t.name} alive status before join: {t.is_alive()}")

# Block until every worker thread finishes
for t in threads:
    t.join()
    print(f"Thread {t.name} alive status after join: {t.is_alive()}")
```

## 4. Concurrent I/O Acceleration Benchmark

Here is a practical benchmark illustrating concurrency gains when downloading mock web endpoints:

```python
import time

def fetch_mock_api(endpoint_id: int) -> None:
    # time.sleep releases the GIL, simulating network round-trip time
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Sequential execution: 5 calls * 0.1s = ~0.50s
start_seq = time.perf_counter()
for i in range(5):
    fetch_mock_api(i)
seq_duration = time.perf_counter() - start_seq
print(f"Sequential I/O Duration: {seq_duration:.3f}s")

# Concurrent multithreaded execution: 5 calls in parallel = ~0.10s
start_thr = time.perf_counter()
worker_threads = [
    threading.Thread(target=fetch_mock_api, args=(i,))
    for i in range(5)
]
for t in worker_threads:
    t.start()
for t in worker_threads:
    t.join()
thr_duration = time.perf_counter() - start_thr
print(f"Concurrent Thread I/O Duration: {thr_duration:.3f}s (Speedup: {seq_duration/thr_duration:.1f}x)")
```

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
What is the primary constraint imposed by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) on Python threads in CPython?
A. Python programs cannot spawn more than 10 threads.
B. Only one native thread can execute Python bytecode at any single instant, even on multi-core processors.
C. Threads cannot open files.
D. Threads cannot access variables in the main thread.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The GIL in CPython synchronizes thread execution so that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, preventing true multi-core parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.

---

### 2.
Why does multithreading in Python dramatically speed up I/O-bound workloads despite the GIL?
A. The GIL is permanently deleted during I/O operations.
B. When a thread performs I/O operations (such as waiting for network or disk), CPython releases the GIL, allowing other threads to run concurrently.
C. CPython converts I/O operations into GPU kernels.
D. The operating system pauses all other processes.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Built-in I/O operations and sleep statements explicitly release the GIL while waiting on operating system system-calls, enabling high concurrency across network and disk activities.

---

### 3.
What method should you call to begin concurrent execution of a `threading.Thread` instance?
A. `thread.run()`
B. `thread.start()`
C. `thread.execute()`
D. `thread.spawn()`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Calling `.start()` instructs the OS to allocate and launch a native thread that executes `run()`. Calling `.run()` directly simply executes the function synchronously inside the current thread.

---

### 4.
What is the purpose of the `thread.join()` method?
A. It terminates the target thread immediately.
B. It merges the memory address spaces of two threads.
C. It blocks the calling thread until the target thread finishes execution.
D. It pauses the thread until user input is received.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** `join()` pauses the calling thread (often the main application thread) until the thread upon which it is called has finished its execution.

---

### 5.
When subclassing `threading.Thread`, which method must be overridden to define the thread's background execution logic?
A. `__call__()`
B. `execute()`
C. `run()`
D. `main()`

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** In a custom subclass of `threading.Thread`, the `run()` method contains the code that will be executed once the thread is started via `.start()`.
