# Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads execute concurrently within the same process, they share a unified memory space. While this shared heap enables fast inter-thread communication without serialization, it introduces severe hazards: **race conditions**, **memory corruption**, and **deadlocks**.

The `threading` module provides synchronization primitives—`Lock`, `RLock`, `Semaphore`, `Event`, and `Condition`—to coordinate shared access safely.

## 1. The Mechanics of a Race Condition

Even a seemingly trivial operation such as `counter += 1` is **not atomic** in Python bytecode:

```
 Thread 1 Execution Flow                 Thread 2 Execution Flow
         │                                       │
 1. LOAD_FAST counter (reads 0)                  │
         │ (Context switch to Thread 2)          │
         │                             1. LOAD_FAST counter (reads 0)
         │                             2. BINARY_ADD 1 (evaluates 1)
         │                             3. STORE_FAST counter (writes 1)
         │ (Context switch back to Thread 1)     │
 2. BINARY_ADD 1 (evaluates 1)                   │
 3. STORE_FAST counter (writes 1)                │
         │                                       │
 Expected Counter Value: 2   ──►   Actual Memory Value: 1 (Race Condition!)
```

```python
import threading
import time

shared_counter = 0

def unsafe_increment() -> None:
    global shared_counter
    for _ in range(100_000):
        # Multiple bytecodes execute; threads context-switch mid-increment
        shared_counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=unsafe_increment) for _ in range(5)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()

print(f"Expected: 500,000 | Actual: {shared_counter}")  # Almost always corrupted!
```

---

## 2. Mutex Locks (`threading.Lock`)

A **Mutex** (Mutual Exclusion lock) ensures that only one thread can execute a critical section at any instant. Always acquire locks using the `with` statement to guarantee release:

```python
shared_safe_counter = 0
counter_lock = threading.Lock()

def safe_increment() -> None:
    global shared_safe_counter
    for _ in range(100_000):
        with counter_lock:  # Automatically acquires and releases
            shared_safe_counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=safe_increment) for _ in range(5)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()

print(f"Safe Expected: 500,000 | Safe Actual: {shared_safe_counter}")  # Guaranteed 500,000
```

---

## 3. Reentrant Locks (`threading.RLock`)

A standard `threading.Lock` cannot be acquired more than once by the same thread. If a method holding a lock calls another method that requests the same lock, execution **deadlocks**.

An **RLock** (Reentrant Lock) tracks the owning thread and an internal acquisition counter. The owning thread can acquire the lock multiple times without blocking, provided it releases it the same number of times:

```python
class AccountManager:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.balance = 100
        self._lock = threading.RLock()  # Reentrant lock allows nested acquisition

    def log_audit(self, message: str) -> None:
        with self._lock:
            print(f"[AUDIT] {message} (Balance: {self.balance})")

    def withdraw(self, amount: int) -> None:
        with self._lock:
            # Invoking log_audit acquires the same lock again
            self.log_audit(f"Withdrawing {amount}")
            self.balance -= amount

account = AccountManager()
account.withdraw(25)  # Succeeds without self-deadlock
```

---

## 4. Resource Throttling with `threading.Semaphore`

A `Semaphore` manages an internal counter. Every `acquire()` decrements the counter; every `release()` increments it. If the counter reaches zero, subsequent acquiring threads block. This is ideal for limiting concurrent access to rate-limited APIs or database connection pools:

```python
import time

# Allow maximum 3 concurrent connections
connection_semaphore = threading.Semaphore(3)

def access_database_pool(client_id: int) -> None:
    with connection_semaphore:
        print(f"[POOL] Client #{client_id} acquired DB connection slot.")
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print(f"[POOL] Client #{client_id} released slot.")

clients = [threading.Thread(target=access_database_pool, args=(i,)) for i in range(7)]
for c in clients: c.start()
for c in clients: c.join()
```

---

## 5. Signaling with `threading.Event`

An `Event` manages an internal boolean flag (`False` by default). One thread can signal other threads to proceed by calling `event.set()`, while consumer threads pause via `event.wait()`:

```python
server_ready_event = threading.Event()

def initialize_database():
    print("[INIT] Loading schema, configurations, and cache...")
    time.sleep(0.3)
    print("[INIT] System initialization complete!")
    server_ready_event.set()  # Flips flag to True; wakes up all waiting threads

def api_listener(worker_id: int):
    print(f"[WORKER {worker_id}] Waiting for database to become ready...")
    server_ready_event.wait()  # Blocks until event.set() is called
    print(f"[WORKER {worker_id}] Database ready. Accepting client connections.")

init_thread = threading.Thread(target=initialize_database)
workers = [threading.Thread(target=api_listener, args=(i,)) for i in range(3)]

for w in workers: w.start()
init_thread.start()

init_thread.join()
for w in workers: w.join()
```

## 6. Architectural Summary Table

| Primitive | Mechanism | Primary Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Lock` | Binary mutex (locked / unlocked) | Protecting critical sections and shared mutable data |
| `RLock` | Reentrant mutex with recursion counter | Recursive function calls or nested class methods |
| `Semaphore` | Counter-based permits | Throttling concurrency (connection pools, rate limits) |
| `Event` | Boolean flag (`wait` / `set` / `clear`) | One-to-many thread signaling and coordination |
| `Condition` | Lock associated with a wait queue | Complex producer-consumer pipelines |

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
Why does `counter += 1` lead to race conditions in multithreaded Python despite the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?
A. The GIL is disabled in loops.
B. The `+=` operation compiles down to multiple bytecode instructions (`LOAD_FAST`, `BINARY_ADD`, `STORE_FAST`), and thread switching can occur between them.
C. Integers in Python are stored on disk.
D. Hardware threads always ignore the GIL.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** In CPython, `+=` is not atomic at the bytecode level. The interpreter can switch threads after reading the variable but before writing the updated value back, resulting in lost updates.

---

### 2.
What will happen if a thread that already holds a standard `threading.Lock` attempts to acquire that same lock a second time?
A. The second attempt returns `True` immediately.
B. The lock is released.
C. The thread blocks waiting for itself to release the lock, causing a deadlock.
D. A `TypeError` is raised.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** A standard `threading.Lock` is non-reentrant; if the owning thread attempts to re-acquire it, it blocks waiting for the lock to become free, permanently deadlocking itself.

---

### 3.
Which synchronization primitive should be chosen when a single thread needs to acquire the same lock multiple times in recursive or nested function calls?
A. `threading.Lock`
B. `threading.RLock`
C. `threading.Event`
D. `threading.Barrier`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `threading.RLock` (Reentrant Lock) tracks the identity of the owning thread and its acquisition depth, allowing the owner to acquire it multiple times without blocking.

---

### 4.
What is the primary function of a `threading.Semaphore(value=5)`?
A. To guarantee that exactly 5 threads terminate at the same time.
B. To allow up to 5 concurrent threads to hold the resource simultaneously before blocking additional requests.
C. To create 5 separate memory heaps.
D. To broadcast a stop signal to 5 worker threads.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** A Semaphore maintains an internal counter initialized to $N$ that allows up to $N$ simultaneous acquisitions, effectively throttling access to limited resources.

---

### 5.
Which method on a `threading.Event` object is used by waiting worker threads to block until a signal flag is set to `True`?
A. `event.set()`
B. `event.wait()`
C. `event.listen()`
D. `event.block()`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `event.wait()` pauses the calling thread until the event's internal boolean flag is set to `True` via a call to `event.set()`.
