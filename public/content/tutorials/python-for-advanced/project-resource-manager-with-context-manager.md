# Project: Resource Manager with Context Manager

In distributed computing and enterprise backend systems, safely managing critical external resources—such as file locks, scratch workspaces, database connections, and transactional state—is essential to prevent data corruption and resource leaks.

In this project, we will design and construct a production-ready **Atomic File Transaction & Workspace Manager**. It guarantees ACID-like atomicity for file updates: modifications are executed within an isolated staging environment and committed atomically only upon successful completion. If an error occurs, modifications are automatically rolled back, leaving the original resources untouched.

---

## 1. Project Requirements & Architecture

The Resource Manager must fulfill the following operational criteria:

1. **Isolation**: All write operations occur on a temporary staging buffer rather than directly mutating the target file.
2. **Atomicity**: The target file is updated via an atomic filesystem swap (`os.replace`) only when the `with` block finishes cleanly without exceptions.
3. **Rollback Guarantee**: In the event of any failure (validation error, network abort, or disk error), all staged artifacts are purged, preserving the original file.
4. **Context Protocol Compliance**: Fully implement `__enter__` and `__exit__`, handling exception inspection and suppression policies.
5. **Telemetry & Audit Trail**: Track execution latency, bytes written, and operational status.

## 2. Production Implementation

```python
import os
import shutil
import tempfile
import time
from typing import IO, Optional, Type
from types import TracebackType

class AtomicFileWriter:
    """A context manager that guarantees atomic write operations to a file.
    
    All writes are directed to a temporary staging file located in the same
    directory as the destination. On clean completion, an atomic filesystem
    replacement replaces the original target with the staging file.
    """

    def __init__(self, target_path: str, mode: str = "w", encoding: str = "utf-8") -> None:
        self.target_path = os.path.abspath(target_path)
        self.mode = mode
        self.encoding = encoding
        self._dir = os.path.dirname(self.target_path)
        self._temp_path: Optional[str] = None
        self._file_handle: Optional[IO] = None
        self.bytes_written = 0
        self.start_time = 0.0

    def __enter__(self) -> IO:
        """Initializes the staging file and returns the open file handle."""
        os.makedirs(self._dir, exist_ok=True)
        self.start_time = time.perf_counter()

        # Create temporary file in the same filesystem/directory to guarantee atomic rename
        prefix = f".{os.path.basename(self.target_path)}.tmp_"

        return self._file_handle

    def __exit__(
        self,
        exc_type: Optional[Type[BaseException]],
        exc_val: Optional[BaseException],
        exc_tb: Optional[TracebackType]
    ) -> bool:

## 3. Alternative Implementation Using `contextlib`

For lightweight transactional scopes, the same architectural pattern can be expressed succinctly using `@contextlib.contextmanager`:

```python
import contextlib
import os
import tempfile
from typing import Generator, IO

@contextlib.contextmanager
def atomic_write(filepath: str, mode: str = "w", encoding: str = "utf-8") -> Generator[IO, None, None]:
    """Generator-based atomic file writer using contextlib."""
    abs_path = os.path.abspath(filepath)
    directory = os.path.dirname(abs_path)
    os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)
    
    fd, temp_path = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix=".tmp_write_", dir=directory)
    handle = open(fd, mode=mode, encoding=encoding)
    
    try:
        yield handle
        handle.flush()
        os.fsync(handle.fileno())
        handle.close()
        os.replace(temp_path, abs_path)
        print(f"[CONTEXTLIB] Successfully committed: {abs_path}")
    except BaseException as err:
        handle.close()
        if os.path.exists(temp_path):
            os.remove(temp_path)
        print(f"[CONTEXTLIB] Aborted and purged temporary file due to: {err}")
        raise
```

---

## 4. Verification and Demonstration

```python
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Demonstration Scenario 1: Successful Atomic Commit
# -------------------------------------------------------------
target_file = "production_config.json"

# Write initial baseline file
with open(target_file, "w") as f:
    f.write('{"status": "INITIAL_VERSION", "cluster_size": 3}')

print("--- Scenario 1: Successful Update ---")
with AtomicFileWriter(target_file) as writer:
    writer.write('{"status": "UPDATED_VERSION", "cluster_size": 10}')

with open(target_file, "r") as f:
    print(f"File content after success: {f.read()}\n")

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Demonstration Scenario 2: Rollback on Error
# -------------------------------------------------------------
print("--- Scenario 2: Error During Write (Automatic Rollback) ---")
try:
    with AtomicFileWriter(target_file) as writer:
        writer.write('{"status": "CORRUPTED_INCOMPLETE_PAYLOAD"')
        # Simulate unexpected application failure mid-write
        raise ValueError("Invalid payload: schema validation failed!")
except ValueError as err:
    print(f"Caught error in caller: {err}")

# Verify that original file was not corrupted
with open(target_file, "r") as f:
    print(f"File content after rollback: {f.read()}")

# Clean up test artifact
if os.path.exists(target_file):
    os.remove(target_file)
```

## 5. Architectural Key Takeaways

1. **Atomic File Swaps**: The `os.replace` system call is atomic on POSIX and modern Windows systems provided both the source and target reside on the same filesystem mount.
2. **Deterministic Cleanup**: By utilizing `__exit__` and `os.fsync`, in-flight buffers are forced onto non-volatile storage before replacement occurs, avoiding partially written files during system power loss.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Business code focuses exclusively on writing data, while the context manager guarantees transactional safety and error recovery.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1.
Why must the temporary staging file in an atomic file writer be created on the same filesystem directory as the destination file?
A. Because Python cannot create files in other directories.
B. Because atomic replacement operations like `os.replace()` require both paths to reside on the same filesystem/drive.
C. To save disk space.
D. Because Windows does not support paths longer than 8 characters.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** In both POSIX (`rename`) and Windows (`SetFileInformationByHandle`), atomic filesystem swaps only work if both files reside on the same physical volume/mount. Cross-filesystem operations require copy-and-delete, which is not atomic.

---

### 2.
What is the purpose of calling `os.fsync(file.fileno())` before renaming the staging file?
A. It compresses the file using gzip.
B. It flushes operating system kernel write buffers directly to physical non-volatile storage, preventing zero-length files on sudden power loss.
C. It verifies the syntax of the JSON payload.
D. It encrypts the file on disk.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** `os.fsync()` forces the operating system kernel to flush write caches to physical disk sectors, guaranteeing data integrity before the atomic swap takes place.

---

### 3.
In `AtomicFileWriter.__exit__`, what does returning `False` when `exc_type is not None` accomplish?
A. It suppresses the exception and continues execution.
B. It instructs Python to re-raise the exception so the caller is notified of the failure.
C. It deletes the destination file completely.
D. It restarts the Python interpreter.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Returning `False` (or `None`) from `__exit__` instructs the runtime to propagate the caught exception up the call stack, ensuring the caller is aware that an error occurred.

---

### 4.
What occurs to the temporary staging file if an exception is raised inside the `with AtomicFileWriter(...)` block?
A. It is permanently retained on disk.
B. It is automatically closed and deleted via `os.remove()` in `__exit__`.
C. It replaces the original target file anyway.
D. It is renamed to `.corrupt`.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The error-handling logic in `__exit__` detects the exception, closes the handle, and removes the staging file, ensuring that no partially written temporary artifacts linger.

---

### 5.
Which standard library module provides the `mkstemp` function used to securely create uniquely named temporary files?
A. `os`
B. `tempfile`
C. `sys`
D. `contextlib`

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The `tempfile` module provides `tempfile.mkstemp()`, which generates uniquely named temporary files safely without race conditions.
