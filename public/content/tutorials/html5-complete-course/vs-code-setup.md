# VS Code Setup (The Best Tool for HTML Coding)

Welcome to Topic 1.3! 💻

In Topics 1.1 and 1.2, you learned what HTML is and what a standard HTML document looks like. Now comes the practical question: **Where do we write our HTML code?**

You can write HTML in basic Windows **Notepad**. But in Notepad, all text looks plain black, there is no automatic error checking, and you have to manually refresh your browser every time you make a change.

Imagine writing with a plain wooden pencil versus having a **Smart Digital Pen** that:
- Highlights words in bright, helpful colors,
- Automatically corrects your spelling,
- And helps you finish your work 5 times faster!

That smart software is called a **Code Editor**. The most popular, fastest, and 100% free code editor in the world is **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, made by Microsoft.

# Creating Your First HTML Folder and File

Now let us set up your workspace to write your first webpage:

1. **Create a New Project Folder:**
   On your computer (on the Desktop or in your D: Drive), create a new folder named: `html-practice`.

2. **Open the Folder in VS Code:**
   - Launch VS Code.
   - In the top menu bar, click: **File ➡️ Open Folder...**
   - Select your new `html-practice` folder.

3. **Create a New HTML File:**
   - On the left sidebar (EXPLORER), you will see your folder name.
   - Click the **New File** 📄 icon next to the folder name.
   - Type the filename: `index.html` and press **Enter**.

> 📌 **Why name it `index.html`?**
> Every web server and browser looks for `index.html` as the default home page of a website. That is why developers always name their primary webpage `index.html`.

# Magic Trick: Generate Full Boilerplate in 1 Second (Emmet)

You do not need to manually type the whole boilerplate skeleton every time!

1. In your empty `index.html` file, type just an exclamation mark: **`!`**
2. You will see a small popup menu labeled "Emmet Abbreviation".
3. Press **`Enter`** or **`Tab`** on your keyboard.

💥 **Boom!** The complete HTML5 boilerplate code will instantly appear on your screen:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```
