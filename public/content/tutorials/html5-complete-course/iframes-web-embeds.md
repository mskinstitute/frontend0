# Iframes & Web Embeds (A Window into Other Websites) 🪟

Welcome to Topic 10.3 in **Chapter 10: Media**!

In the previous lessons, you learned how to add local photos with `<img>` and host your own videos with `<video>`.

Now imagine you want to:
- Embed an **interactive Google Map** on your school's "Contact Us" page showing the exact route from the bus stand.
- Embed a **YouTube educational lecture** without downloading huge 1 GB video files to your computer.
- Show an **interactive PhET physics simulation** where students can adjust pendulums and circuits live on your page.

How do you display content from an entirely different website inside your own page?

The answer is the **HTML `<iframe>` element**!

# The Real-Life School Analogy: The Classroom Window & CCTV Screen 📺

Think about your **school classroom**:

### 1. The Glass Window
Sitting at your study desk, there is a large glass window in the wall. Through that window, you can watch what is happening outside on the school sports field &mdash; the green grass, the football match, the clouds in the sky. You are sitting in the classroom, but you can see a view of the outside world!

### 2. The Principal's CCTV Monitor
In the Principal's office, there is a television monitor showing live CCTV feeds from the school gate, science lab, and library. The monitor is a small screen inside the room that shows external video feeds live!

An **`<iframe>` (Inline Frame)** is literally that glass window or CCTV screen on your webpage! It cuts out a rectangular area on your page and streams an entirely different website or video player directly inside it!

---

# 1. The Basic Syntax of `<iframe>` 📐

The `<iframe>` tag requires an opening tag and a closing tag:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://example.com" 
  width="600" 
  height="400" 
  title="Example Website Preview"
>
  <!-- Fallback message for very old browsers -->
  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
</iframe>
```

### Essential Attributes:
1. **`src`**: The URL address of the webpage or video you want to embed inside the frame.
2. **`width` & `height`**: The dimensions in pixels (e.g. `width="600" height="400"`).
3. **`title` (⚠️ Mandatory for Accessibility!)**: Screen reader software announces this title so visually impaired students know what is inside the frame (e.g. `title="School Location Map"`).

---

# 2. Embedding YouTube Video Lectures 🎥

Many beginners make this mistake: they copy the normal YouTube address from their browser (`youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE`) and paste it into `src`.

When they open their webpage, YouTube shows an error: *"Refused to connect"*!

### Why does this happen?
YouTube blocks normal watch links from loading inside iframes for security. Instead, you must use YouTube's special **`/embed/` URL**:

```html
<!-- ❌ WRONG: Normal Watch Link (Will NOT work inside an iframe!) -->
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE"></iframe>

<!-- ✅ CORRECT: YouTube Embed Link -->
<iframe 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUMe1FH4CHE" 
  width="560" 
  height="315" 
  title="HTML5 Tutorial Video for Beginners" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

### Pro-Tips for YouTube Embeds:
- **`allowfullscreen`**: Allows students to click the square icon and watch the video in full-screen mode!
- **`allow="..."`**: Grants permissions for motion sensors, autoplay, and picture-in-picture mode.

# 3. Embedding Interactive Google Maps 🗺️

Every school, college, or business website needs a map on its "Contact Us" page so parents and students can find the campus:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Visit Our Campus</h2>
  <p>Delhi Public Model School is located on Station Road, Shikohabad (UP).</p>

  <iframe 
    src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d14197.882194380145!2d78.5833!3d27.1000!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zMjfCsDA2JzAwLjAiTiA3OMKwMzUnMDAuMCJF!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1600000000000" 
    width="600" 
    height="350" 
    style="border:0;" 
    allowfullscreen="" 
    loading="lazy" 
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
    title="Google Map showing School Campus Location"
  ></iframe>
</section>
```

#### How to get this link in 10 seconds:
1. Open Google Maps and search for your school or city.
2. Click **Share** &rarr; select the **"Embed a map"** tab.
3. Click **"Copy HTML"** and paste it directly into your web page!

---

# 4. Supercharging Performance: `loading="lazy"` ⚡

If your page contains 3 embedded YouTube videos and a Google Map, downloading all four embedded pages at once will slow down your website and eat up student mobile data!

Add **`loading="lazy"`**:

```html
<iframe src="..." width="600" height="400" title="School Tour" loading="lazy"></iframe>
```

The browser will **wait** to download the iframe until the student actually scrolls down near it. If they never scroll down, zero data is wasted!

---

# 5. Iframe Security: The `sandbox` Shield 🛡️

What if you are embedding a page from a third-party website, and you want to make sure it cannot:
- Steal the user's cookies or login session.
- Pop open annoying virus advertisements.
- Run unauthorized scripts.

HTML5 introduced the **`sandbox` attribute** &mdash; a digital bulletproof glass shield!

```html
<!-- High Security: Completely blocks scripts, popups, and forms -->
<iframe src="https://external-resource.com" sandbox title="External Reading Resource"></iframe>

<!-- Controlled Permissions: Selectively allow only what is safe -->
<iframe 
  src="https://trusted-partner.com" 
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
  title="Partner Portal"
></iframe>
```

### Common `sandbox` Permission Tokens:
- **`allow-scripts`**: Allows JavaScript to execute inside the iframe.
- **`allow-same-origin`**: Allows the iframe to maintain its cookies and domain storage.
- **`allow-forms`**: Allows form submission inside the frame.
- **`allow-popups`**: Allows the iframe to open new tabs.

# Common Beginner Mistakes & Best Practices ⚠️

| ❌ Common Mistake | ✅ Best Practice | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Using a standard YouTube watch URL (`watch?v=...`) in `src`. | Always use the `/embed/` URL format (`youtube.com/embed/...`). | Normal watch links are blocked by YouTube security policies and will fail with a blank box. |
| Forgetting the `title` attribute on `<iframe>`. | Always provide a descriptive `title` attribute. | Accessibility screen readers require `title` to announce what is inside the embedded frame. |
| Loading heavy maps and videos above the fold without lazy-loading. | Add `loading="lazy"` to all iframes below the screen fold. | Saves mobile bandwidth and speeds up page load for students on 4G connections. |
| Omitting `allowfullscreen` on video players. | Always include `allowfullscreen` on YouTube/Vimeo iframes. | Without this attribute, users are locked to the tiny iframe dimensions and cannot maximize the video. |
| Writing `<iframe>` as a self-closing tag (`<iframe src="..." />`). | Always write opening and closing tags: `<iframe>...</iframe>`. | `<iframe>` is not a void element. Self-closing will break surrounding HTML layout! |

# Quick Summary (Revision Notes) 🧠

- **`<iframe>` (Inline Frame)** embeds an external webpage, video player, or interactive map directly inside your page.
- **`src`** points to the document or media URL to display.
- **YouTube Embeds:** Must use the `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID` URL structure.
- **`allowfullscreen`** enables full-screen video playback.
- **`title="..."`** is mandatory for accessible screen reader navigation.
- **`loading="lazy"`** delays downloading the frame until the visitor scrolls near it.
- **`sandbox`** provides a powerful security shield to restrict untrusted scripts and popups.
