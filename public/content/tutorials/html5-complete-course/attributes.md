# HTML Attributes (Adding Superpowers to Tags)

Welcome to Topic 1.5! ⚡

In the previous lesson, you mastered **HTML Elements**—the basic building blocks of any webpage. Now, imagine you have a plain button or a link on your page. How do you tell the computer:
- Where should this link take the user when clicked?
- Which photo should be displayed inside an image tag?
- What size should the image be?

The answer is: **HTML Attributes**! Attributes give tags extra information and superpowers.

# What is an HTML Attribute?

An **Attribute** provides additional settings, properties, or behavior to an HTML element.

Let us understand this with a simple real-life example: **Your School ID Card!** 🪪

```text
🪪 THE SCHOOL ID CARD ANALOGY:

You are a student (an Element):         <student> Rohit </student>

Your ID Card contains your Attributes:
- Roll Number: rollno="24"
- Class:       class="10th"
- House:       house="Red"
- Blood Group: blood="B+"

Complete Element with Attributes:
<student rollno="24" class="10th" house="Red"> Rohit </student>
```

Just like your ID card gives extra details about who you are, **HTML attributes give extra instructions about how an element should behave**.

# The Golden Rules of HTML Attributes

Every beginner must remember these 4 simple rules:

1. **Always in the Opening Tag:** Attributes are **ONLY** written inside the opening tag (start tag). They are **NEVER** written in the closing tag!
2. **Name and Value Pair:** Attributes usually come in pairs: `name="value"`.
3. **Always Use Quotes:** Always wrap the value in double quotation marks (`"..."`).
4. **Use Spaces, Not Commas:** If you use multiple attributes in one tag, separate them with a simple space. Never put commas between them!

```html
<!-- Anatomy of an Attribute -->
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google</a>
── ──────────┬────────────── ───────┬──────
 │           │                      │
Tag    Attribute 1             Attribute 2
```

# The Most Common HTML Attributes You Must Know

Here are the most essential attributes every web developer uses every single day:

### 1. The `href` Attribute (For Links)
The `<a>` tag creates clickable hyperlinks. The `href` (Hypertext Reference) attribute tells the browser **which web address (URL)** to open when someone clicks the link:

```html
<a href="https://mskinstitute.in">Visit MSK Institute Website</a>
```

If you don't provide an `href` attribute, the link has nowhere to go!

---

### 2. The `src` Attribute (For Images)
The `<img>` tag displays a picture on your screen. The `src` (Source) attribute tells the browser **where to find the image file**:

```html
<img src="student-award.jpg" alt="Student receiving trophy">
```

- `src` can be a file on your computer (like `myphoto.png`) or a link from the internet (like `https://example.com/logo.png`).

---

### 3. The `alt` Attribute (Alternate Description for Images)
The `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image.

**Why is `alt` so important?**
1. **Broken Images:** If the user's internet is slow or the image file cannot be found, the browser shows this text instead of an ugly broken icon.
2. **Accessibility:** Blind or visually impaired users use "Screen Reader" software that reads the `alt` text aloud to describe the picture!

```html
<!-- If the photo fails to load, users still read: "MSK Computer Lab" -->
<img src="lab.jpg" alt="MSK Computer Lab with students coding">
```

---

### 4. The `width` and `height` Attributes (Setting Image Dimensions)
You can control the size of images using `width` and `height` (measured in pixels):

```html
<img src="school-logo.png" alt="School Logo" width="200" height="100">
```

---

### 5. The `title` Attribute (The Tooltip Helper)
When you add a `title` attribute to any element, a small floating text box (called a **tooltip**) appears whenever a user hovers their mouse cursor over that element!

```html
<p title="Click to read about our computer courses">
  Hover your mouse over this paragraph!
</p>
```

---

### 6. The `target` Attribute (Open in a New Tab)
By default, clicking a link replaces the current webpage. If you want the link to open in a **fresh new browser tab**, use `target="_blank"`:

```html
<a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Open YouTube in New Tab</a>
```

---

### 7. The `lang` Attribute (Declaring Page Language)
As you saw in the boilerplate lesson, the `lang` attribute is used inside the `<html>` root tag to tell search engines and translation tools the language of the page:

```html
<html lang="en"> <!-- English -->
<html lang="hi"> <!-- Hindi -->
```

# Summary Table of Key Attributes

| Attribute | Used In Tags | What It Specifies | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `href` | `<a>` | Link destination URL | `<a href="https://google.com">` |
| `src` | `<img>`, `<video>`, `<script>` | Path or URL to the file | `<img src="pic.jpg">` |
| `alt` | `<img>` | Alternate description text | `<img alt="School Logo">` |
| `width` / `height` | `<img>`, `<video>` | Size dimensions in pixels | `<img width="300">` |
| `title` | Any tag | Mouse hover tooltip text | `<h1 title="Welcome!">` |
| `target` | `<a>` | Where to open the link | `<a target="_blank">` |
| `lang` | `<html>` | Document language | `<html lang="en">` |

# What are Boolean Attributes? (True / False Attributes)

Some special HTML attributes do not need a `"value"`. Their mere presence inside a tag turns on that feature! These are called **Boolean Attributes**.

### Common Examples:
1. **`disabled`:** Turns off an input field or button so users cannot click or type into it.
   ```html
   <button disabled>Button is Disabled</button>
   ```

2. **`required`:** Makes an input field mandatory in a form (user cannot submit without filling it).
   ```html
   <input type="text" required>
   ```

3. **`readonly`:** Users can read the text but cannot edit or change it.
   ```html
   <input type="text" value="Read only text" readonly>
   ```

# Common Beginner Mistakes with Attributes

1. ⚠️ **Writing Attributes in Closing Tags:**
   - ❌ Wrong: `</p title="Hello">`
   - ✅ Correct: `<p title="Hello">`

   - ❌ Wrong: `<a href=https://google.com>`
   - ✅ Correct: `<a href="https://google.com">`

3. ⚠️ **Spelling Mistakes in Attribute Names:**
   - ❌ Wrong: `<img scr="photo.jpg">` *(Many beginners type `scr` instead of `src`!)*
   - ✅ Correct: `<img src="photo.jpg">`

4. ⚠️ **Using Commas Between Attributes:**
   - ❌ Wrong: `<img src="photo.jpg", alt="Photo", width="200">`
   - ✅ Correct: `<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo" width="200">`

     ```html
     <a href="https://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Visit Wikipedia</a>
     ```

     ```html
     <p title="Tip: You are doing great in web development!">Hover over this tip!</p>
