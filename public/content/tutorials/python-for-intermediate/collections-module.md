# The Collections Module in Python

Python's built-in general-purpose containers—`dict`, `list`, `set`, and `tuple`—are versatile, but certain high-performance algorithmic tasks demand specialized data structures. The **`collections`** module provides high-performance container alternatives that eliminate boilerplate and dramatically optimize time complexity.

## 1. The Core Containers in `collections`

```text
collections
 ├── Counter        # Frequency tracker for hashable objects
 ├── defaultdict    # Dictionary with automatic default value factory
 ├── deque          # Double-ended queue with O(1) pops and appends at both ends
 ├── namedtuple     # Factory for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
 ├── OrderedDict    # Dictionary preserving order with reordering methods
 └── ChainMap       # View for searching multiple dictionaries as one
```

---

## 2. `namedtuple`: Readable, Lightweight Records

Tuples access values by numeric indices (`p[0]`, `p[1]`), which hurts readability. `namedtuple` assigns field names to each position while maintaining tuple immutability and near-zero memory overhead compared to full class instances:

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define schema
Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y", "label"])

# Instantiate
p1 = Point(12, 25, "NodeA")

# Access by field name OR numeric index
print(f"Label: {p1.label}, Coordinates: ({p1.x}, {p1.y})")
print(p1[0])  # 12 (Indexable like a tuple)

# Immutability preserved
# p1.x = 99  # AttributeError: can't set attribute
```

---

## 3. `deque`: Double-Ended Queue ($O(1)$ Performance)

In Python, a standard `list` is a contiguous dynamic array. Calling `list.pop(0)` or `list.insert(0, val)` has an expensive **$O(n)$** time complexity because every subsequent element must be shifted in memory.

A **`deque`** (pronounced "deck") is implemented as a doubly linked list of blocks, guaranteeing **$O(1)$** instantaneous operations from both the left and right ends:

```python
from collections import deque

queue = deque(["Task1", "Task2", "Task3"], maxlen=4)

# Fast O(1) operations on both ends
queue.append("Task4")          # Append right
queue.appendleft("PriorityTask") # Prepend left (Evicts Task4 because maxlen=4!)

print(list(queue))
# Output: ['PriorityTask', 'Task1', 'Task2', 'Task3']

# Fast O(1) removals
first = queue.popleft()  # 'PriorityTask'
last = queue.pop()       # 'Task3'
print(f"Remaining: {list(queue)}")
```

---

## 4. `Counter`: High-Speed Frequency Counting

`Counter` is a dictionary subclass specifically designed for counting items and analyzing distributions:

```python
from collections import Counter

words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple", "mango"]
counts = Counter(words)

print(counts)
# Output: Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1, 'mango': 1})

# Direct lookup of non-existent key returns 0 instead of KeyError!
print(counts["grapes"])  # 0

# Retrieve top N most frequent elements
top_two = counts.most_common(2)
print("Top 2:", top_two)  # [('apple', 3), ('banana', 2)]

# Arithmetic between counters
c1 = Counter(a=3, b=1)
c2 = Counter(a=1, b=2)
print("Combined:", c1 + c2)  # Counter({'a': 4, 'b': 3})
```

---

## 5. `defaultdict`: Eliminating `KeyError`

A standard Python dictionary raises a `KeyError` when accessing a key that does not exist. A `defaultdict` automatically invokes a callable factory function (such as `list`, `int`, or `set`) to initialize missing keys on first access:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# 1. Grouping items into lists
grouped_students = defaultdict(list)

records = [("CS", "Aarav"), ("EE", "Priya"), ("CS", "Rohan"), ("ME", "Vikram")]

for department, student in records:
    # No need to write: if department not in grouped_students: grouped_students[department] = []
    grouped_students[department].append(student)

print(dict(grouped_students))
# Output: {'CS': ['Aarav', 'Rohan'], 'EE': ['Priya'], 'ME': ['Vikram']}

# 2. Integer counter factory
word_counts = defaultdict(int)
for char in "mississippi":
    word_counts[char] += 1  # Missing keys initialize to int() -> 0
print(dict(word_counts))
```

## 6. Data Structure Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Best Structure | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue | `collections.deque` | $O(1)$ `popleft()` vs $O(n)$ in `list` |
| Frequency tallying / histogram | `collections.Counter` | Built-in arithmetic & `.most_common()` |
| Grouping items by key | `collections.defaultdict(list)` | Eliminates manual existence checks |
| Lightweight immutable record | `collections.namedtuple` | Clean dot-notation with tuple efficiency |

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What is the time complexity of removing an item from the beginning of a `collections.deque` using `popleft()`?
A. $O(n)$
B. $O(n^2)$
C. $O(1)$
D. $O(\log n)$
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `deque` provides $O(1)$ constant time complexity for insertions and deletions at both ends, whereas standard list `pop(0)` is $O(n)$.
---

### 2. What happens when you query a key that has not been added to a `collections.Counter`?
A. It raises a `KeyError`
B. It returns `0`
C. It returns `None`
D. It adds the key with value `-1`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `Counter` returns `0` for missing keys instead of raising a `KeyError`.
---

### 3. Which factory function passed to `defaultdict` allows appending elements to missing keys without initialization?
A. `defaultdict(dict)`
B. `defaultdict(list)`
C. `defaultdict(set)`
D. `defaultdict(tuple)`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Passing `list` as the factory function creates a new empty list `[]` for any accessed key that does not exist yet.
---

### 4. What is a key advantage of `namedtuple` over a standard dictionary for fixed records?
A. `namedtuple` fields can be dynamically reassigned at runtime
B. `namedtuple` is memory-compact and immutable, with dot notation attribute access
C. `namedtuple` cannot be iterated over
D. `namedtuple` runs only on multi-core CPUs
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `namedtuple` instances are immutable and have a memory footprint identical to standard tuples, while providing readable dot notation like `point.x`.
---

### 5. What happens when you append an element to a `deque` that has already reached its configured `maxlen`?
A. An `OverflowError` is raised
B. The item on the opposite end is automatically discarded
C. The deque resizes itself automatically to double its capacity
D. The new element is rejected
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When a bounded `deque` with `maxlen` is full, appending an item to one end automatically evicts an item from the opposite end.
