# Advanced Context Managers: Custom Classes, contextlib, and Exception Suppression

In beginner Python, you learned to use `with open(...) as f:` to prevent file descriptor leaks. In intermediate Python engineering, context managers are not limited to files—they are the premier architectural mechanism for managing any resource with a paired setup and teardown lifecycle (database connections, network sockets, thread locks, and temporary directories).

In this lesson, you will master the **Context Management Protocol** from first principles, build custom class-based context managers, suppress exceptions deterministically via `__exit__`, and write generator-based managers using the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator.

## Real-World Analogy: The High-Security Jewellery Vault & Clean Room

Imagine entering a sterile pharmaceutical laboratory or an automated jewelry vault in Zaveri Bazaar, Mumbai:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  AUTOMATED JEWELLERY VAULT CLEAN ROOM                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|  1. Entry (__enter__):                                                  |
|     ──> Decontamination airlock turns on, sterile lights illuminate.    |
|     ──> Passes the master keycard / workbench reference to jeweler.     |
|                                                                         |
|  2. Execution (Inside with block):                                      |
|     ──> Jeweler grades diamonds, cuts gemstones, logs inventory.        |
|                                                                         |
|  3. Exit (__exit__):                                                    |
|     ──> Automatic airlock seals, UV sterilization runs, security locks.  |
|     ──> WHAT IF A MEDICAL ALARM FIRED INSIDE? (Exception raised)       |
|         __exit__ inspects the alarm (exc_type, exc_val).                |
|         It can swallow the panic (return True) or propagate (return False)|
|         Either way, the vault is guaranteed to be sterilized and locked!|
|                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Regardless of whether operations complete smoothly or an unexpected exception halts execution, the teardown code is guaranteed to run deterministically.

## The Protocol Anatomy: `__enter__` and `__exit__`

Any Python class can become a context manager by implementing two dunder methods:

```python
class CustomManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        # 1. Allocate resource & setup environment
        # Return value is bound to variable after 'as'
        return resource

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # 2. Teardown / cleanup resource
        # exc_type: Exception class (or None if no error)
        # exc_val : Exception instance (or None)
        # exc_tb  : Traceback object (or None)
        
        # Return True to SUPPRESS exception, or False/None to PROPAGATE
        return False
```

---

## Exception Suppression Rule in `__exit__`

When an exception occurs inside a `with` block:
- Python invokes `__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)` with the error details.
- If `__exit__` returns **`True`**, Python suppresses the exception—execution continues outside the block as if nothing happened!
- If `__exit__` returns **`False`** (or `None`), the exception propagates upward normally.

## Comprehensive Code Examples

### 1. Custom Class-Based Execution Timer Context Manager

```python
import time

class PerformanceTimer:
    """Measures and logs elapsed time of a block of code."""
    def __init__(self, block_name):
        self.block_name = block_name
        self.start_time = None
        self.elapsed = None

    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"[TIMER START] '{self.block_name}' benchmark initiated.")
        self.start_time = time.perf_counter()
        return self  # Expose timer instance to the 'as' variable

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.elapsed = (time.perf_counter() - self.start_time) * 1000
        print(f"[TIMER END] '{self.block_name}' completed in {self.elapsed:.3f} ms")
        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f"            Note: An error occurred inside block: {exc_val}")
        return False  # Do not suppress exceptions

# Measure data processing block
with PerformanceTimer("Indian Railway PNR Batch Parser") as timer:
    total = sum(i ** 2 for i in range(500000))
    print(f"Computed total: {total}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
[TIMER START] 'Indian Railway PNR Batch Parser' benchmark initiated.
Computed total: 41666541666750000
[TIMER END] 'Indian Railway PNR Batch Parser' completed in 18.245 ms
```

### 2. Database Transaction Context Manager (Commit / Rollback)

In database operations, changes should only be committed if all operations succeed; if an error occurs, every modification must roll back:

```python
class DatabaseTransaction:
    """Simulates ACID database transaction management."""
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name
        self.is_active = False

    def __enter__(self):
        self.is_active = True
        print(f"[TXN START] Opened transaction on database '{self.db_name}'.")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.is_active = False
        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f"[TXN ROLLBACK] Error detected ({exc_val})! Rolling back all pending changes.")
            return False  # Propagate error so caller is informed
        else:
            print(f"[TXN COMMIT] All queries succeeded! Committed changes to '{self.db_name}'.")
            return True

# Test 1: Successful Transaction
with DatabaseTransaction("HDFC_Core_Banking"):
    print("  -> Updating Account A balance: -₹5,000")
    print("  -> Updating Account B balance: +₹5,000")

# Test 2: Failed Transaction (Rollback)
print("\n--- Testing Failed Transaction ---")
try:
    with DatabaseTransaction("HDFC_Core_Banking"):
        print("  -> Updating Account A balance: -₹10,000")
        raise ConnectionResetError("Lost connection to branch server mid-transfer")
except ConnectionResetError:
    print("Handled transaction failure gracefully outside with block.")
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
[TXN START] Opened transaction on database 'HDFC_Core_Banking'.
  -> Updating Account A balance: -₹5,000
  -> Updating Account B balance: +₹5,000
[TXN COMMIT] All queries succeeded! Committed changes to 'HDFC_Core_Banking'.

--- Testing Failed Transaction ---
[TXN START] Opened transaction on database 'HDFC_Core_Banking'.
  -> Updating Account A balance: -₹10,000
[TXN ROLLBACK] Error detected (Lost connection to branch server mid-transfer)! Rolling back all pending changes.
Handled transaction failure gracefully outside with block.
```

### 3. Generator-Based Context Managers with `@contextlib.contextmanager`

Writing `__enter__` and `__exit__` boilerplate for simple tasks can feel verbose. The standard library `@contextlib.contextmanager` turns any generator into a context manager using a single `yield`:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import os

@contextmanager
def temporary_working_directory(target_path):
    """Safely changes working directory and guarantees return to original directory."""
    original_cwd = os.getcwd()
    try:
        os.chdir(target_path)
        print(f"[CWD CHANGED] Switched into: {target_path}")
        yield target_path  # Code inside 'with' executes while paused here!
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_cwd)
        print(f"[CWD RESTORED] Restored back to original: {original_cwd}")

# Execute
with temporary_working_directory(".."):
    print("  Inside block cwd:", os.getcwd())

print("Outside block cwd:", os.getcwd())
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
[CWD CHANGED] Switched into: ..
  Inside block cwd: D:\Sumit
[CWD RESTORED] Restored back to original: D:\Sumit\MSK-Institute-Website
Outside block cwd: D:\Sumit\MSK-Institute-Website
```

## Best Practices & Comparison: Do's and Don'ts

| Practice | Bad Implementation | Gold-Standard Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exception Hiding** | Returning `True` blindly from `__exit__` (Silences bugs!) | Only return `True` for specifically expected benign errors |
| **Manual Cleanup** | Relying on developers remembering to call `.close()` | Encapsulate cleanup logic inside `__exit__` or `finally` |
| **Simple Managers** | Writing 25 lines of class boilerplate for 1 resource | Use `@contextlib.contextmanager` with a single `yield` |
| **Yield Handling** | Not wrapping `yield` in `try...finally` | Always protect `yield` with `try...finally` in generators |
| **Resource Leaks** | Forgetting to release resources when exception occurs | Context manager guarantees teardown execution |

## Quick Revision Summary Cheat Sheet

- **Protocol:** `__enter__()` handles setup and returns resource; `__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)` handles teardown.
- **Exception Suppression:** Return `True` from `__exit__` to swallow exceptions; return `False` or `None` to propagate them.
- **`@contextlib.contextmanager`:** Converts generator with `yield` into context manager (`try: yield finally: cleanup`).
- **`contextlib.suppress(*exceptions)`:** Built-in utility to safely ignore non-fatal errors (e.g. `with suppress(FileNotFoundError): os.remove(f)`).

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What parameters does the __exit__ method of a context manager receive?
A. Only `self`
B. `self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb`
C. `self, *args, **kwargs`
D. `self, status_code`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When exiting a `with` block, Python passes four arguments to `__exit__`: the instance reference (`self`), the exception class (`exc_type`), the exception value (`exc_val`), and the traceback object (`exc_tb`). If no error occurred, the latter three are `None`.

---

### 2. How can a custom context manager suppress an exception that was raised inside its with block?
A. By raising a KeyboardInterrupt
B. By explicitly returning True from its `__exit__()` method
C. By deleting the traceback object
D. Exceptions inside with blocks cannot be suppressed
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** If `__exit__()` evaluates to a truthy value (specifically `True`), Python suppresses the exception and resumes normal execution immediately after the `with` block.

---

### 3. In a generator decorated with @contextlib.contextmanager, where must the cleanup code be placed?
A. Before the `yield` statement
B. In a `finally` block following the `yield` statement
C. In a separate `.txt` file
D. Outside the generator function
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Placing cleanup code in a `finally` block guarantees that teardown occurs even if the user code executed during `yield` raises an uncaught exception.

---

### 4. What is the value bound to the variable target in with MyManager() as target:?
A. The `MyManager()` instance itself always
B. Whatever object is returned by the `__enter__()` method of `MyManager`
C. The boolean `True`
D. None
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In `with ContextManager() as alias:`, `alias` is bound strictly to the return value of `__enter__()`, which can be `self`, an opened file, a database connection, or any arbitrary object.

---

### 5. What does the standard library context manager contextlib.suppress(FileNotFoundError) accomplish?
A. Prevents files from being deleted
B. Ignores and swallows FileNotFoundError if it occurs inside the block, allowing execution to continue without crashing
C. Creates an empty file if missing
D. Throws a warning
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `contextlib.suppress(*exceptions)` is a built-in context manager that silences specified non-fatal exceptions, replacing cumbersome `try...except FileNotFoundError: pass` blocks.

# Practice Challenge

### Scenario: Safe File Overwriter Context Manager

When writing critical configuration files (e.g. `settings.json`), modifying the live file directly is dangerous—if the program crashes mid-write, the configuration is corrupted and unreadable!

Build a custom context manager `SafeFileOverwrite(filepath)`:
1. When entered, opens a temporary file `"{filepath}.tmp"` for writing and returns its file handle.
2. If code inside the `with` block completes without errors, `__exit__` closes the temporary file and atomically renames `"{filepath}.tmp"` to `filepath` (replacing the original file safely).
3. If an exception occurs during write, `__exit__` closes and deletes `"{filepath}.tmp"`, leaving the original file completely intact and uncorrupted!

### Starter Code
```python
import os

class SafeFileOverwrite:
    def __init__(self, filepath):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.tmp_path = f"{filepath}.tmp"
        self.file_obj = None

    # TODO: Implement __enter__ and __exit__ with atomic replace and failure cleanup
```

### Complete Solution
```python
import os

class SafeFileOverwrite:
    def __init__(self, filepath):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.tmp_path = f"{filepath}.tmp"
        self.file_obj = None

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file_obj = open(self.tmp_path, "w", encoding="utf-8")
        return self.file_obj

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.file_obj.close()
        
        # If an error occurred inside the block, discard the corrupt temp file
        if exc_type is not None:
            if os.path.exists(self.tmp_path):
                os.remove(self.tmp_path)
            print(f"[RESCUED] Write aborted! Discarded temporary file. Original remains untouched.")
            return False  # Propagate error
        
        # Success: Atomically replace target file
        if os.path.exists(self.filepath):
            os.remove(self.filepath)
        os.rename(self.tmp_path, self.filepath)
        print(f"[ATOMIC COMMIT] File '{self.filepath}' updated successfully.")
        return True

# Test 1: Successful Safe Write
CONFIG_FILE = "system_config.txt"
with SafeFileOverwrite(CONFIG_FILE) as f:
    f.write("database_host=db.mumbai.msk.internal\n")
    f.write("port=5432\n")

print("Current File Content:")
with open(CONFIG_FILE, "r") as r:
    print(r.read().strip())

# Test 2: Crashed Write (Does NOT corrupt original!)
print("\n--- Testing Mid-Write Crash Protection ---")
try:
    with SafeFileOverwrite(CONFIG_FILE) as f:
        f.write("CORRUPT DATA...")
        raise MemoryError("Out of memory during massive write!")
except MemoryError:
    pass

print("\nFile Content After Crash (Verified Uncorrupted):")
with open(CONFIG_FILE, "r") as r:
    print(r.read().strip())

# Clean up
if os.path.exists(CONFIG_FILE):
    os.remove(CONFIG_FILE)
```

### Expected Output
```text
[ATOMIC COMMIT] File 'system_config.txt' updated successfully.
Current File Content:
database_host=db.mumbai.msk.internal
port=5432

--- Testing Mid-Write Crash Protection ---
[RESCUED] Write aborted! Discarded temporary file. Original remains untouched.

File Content After Crash (Verified Uncorrupted):
database_host=db.mumbai.msk.internal
port=5432
```
