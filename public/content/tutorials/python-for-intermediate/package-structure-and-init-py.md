# Python Packages and __init__.py: Architecture and Facades

When software grows beyond a handful of independent scripts, grouping related modules into organized directory hierarchies becomes essential. In Python, a directory structured to contain multiple modules and sub-packages is called a **Package**.

The cornerstone of traditional Python package architecture is the special file named `__init__.py`. In this lesson, you will master package structuring, design clean **API facades** that hide internal plumbing, leverage `__all__` to govern exports, and understand the difference between relative and absolute imports.

## Real-World Analogy: The Multi-Story Hypermarket Reception Desk

Imagine walking into a massive shopping hypermarket like Reliance Retail or Big Bazaar:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  HYPERMARKET RECEPTION DESK ANALOGY                     |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|  Customer Enters Building:                                              |
|  ──> Greeted immediately by the Ground Floor Reception (__init__.py)    |
|                                                                         |
|  Without Reception (__init__.py Facade):                                |
|  ──> Customer is forced to wander through basement boiler rooms,        |
|      internal loading docks, and electrical shafts:                     |
|      from store.internal.storage.baskets.items import buy_milk          |
|                                                                         |
|  With Clean Reception Desk (__init__.py):                               |
|  ──> Receptionist neatly curates the catalog at the main lobby:        |
|      __init__.py imports: from .groceries import buy_milk               |
|  ──> Customer simply asks:                                              |
|      from store import buy_milk (Clean, direct, and pleasant!)          |
|                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

`__init__.py` acts as the front desk receptionist: it initializes the package when imported and presents a curated public interface so external users don't have to know your internal file layout.

## Module vs Package Hierarchy

```
ecommerce_suite/               <-- Top-Level Package Directory
│
├── __init__.py                <-- Package Initializer & Public API Facade
├── orders.py                  <-- Sub-Module
├── inventory.py               <-- Sub-Module
└── payments/                  <-- Sub-Package (Nested Directory)
    ├── __init__.py            <-- Sub-Package Initializer
    ├── upi.py                 <-- Nested Module
    └── card.py                <-- Nested Module
```

---

## The Three Core Responsibilities of `__init__.py`

1. **Marks Directory as a Python Package:**
   While Python 3.3+ supports "Namespace Packages" without `__init__.py`, regular packages require `__init__.py` to execute initialization code and support relative imports.
2. **Package Initialization Logic:**
   Any Python code written inside `__init__.py` executes automatically the first time the package is imported.
3. **Public API Facade & Namespace Simplification:**
   Instead of forcing users to write:
   `from ecommerce_suite.payments.upi import process_upi_payment`
   You can re-export the function in `ecommerce_suite/__init__.py`:
   `from .payments.upi import process_upi_payment`
   Allowing users to simply write:
   `from ecommerce_suite import process_upi_payment`

---

## Relative vs Absolute Imports

Python supports two distinct ways to import between modules inside a package:

```
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
|  Absolute Import                   |  Explicit Relative Import          |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
|  from ecommerce_suite.orders       |  from .orders import place_order   |
|  import place_order                |  from ..payments import upi        |
|                                    |                                    |
|  Starts from project root          |  Uses dots to indicate hierarchy:  |
|  Always unambiguous and clear      |  .  -> Current directory           |
|                                    |  .. -> Parent directory            |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Relative Import Trap:**
> Relative imports only work when code is executed as part of a package (e.g. `python -m package.submodule`). Running a submodule directly (`python package/submodule.py`) breaks relative imports with `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`.

---

## Controlling Exports with `__all__`

When someone writes `from my_package import *`, Python by default imports all names that don't start with an underscore. You can strictly govern which functions are public by defining the `__all__` list in `__init__.py`:

```python
# __init__.py
from .auth import login, logout, _generate_secret_hash

# Only 'login' and 'logout' are exposed to wildcard imports!
__all__ = ["login", "logout"]
```

## Comprehensive Code Examples

### 1. Building a Modular E-Commerce Billing Package

Let us construct an architectural package simulation:

```python
# =============================================================
# simulated_pkg/orders.py
# =============================================================
def create_order(customer_name, items):
    total = sum(i["price"] for i in items)
    return {
        "order_id": "ORD-2026-9021",
        "customer": customer_name,
        "items_count": len(items),
        "total_amount": total
    }

# =============================================================
# simulated_pkg/payments.py
# =============================================================
def pay_via_upi(order_id, amount, vpa):
    return {
        "status": "PAID",
        "txn_id": "UPI-TXN-5544",
        "order_id": order_id,
        "amount": amount,
        "vpa": vpa
    }

# =============================================================
# simulated_pkg/__init__.py (API Facade)
# =============================================================
"""
MSK E-Commerce QuickSuite Package
Provides streamlined order processing and UPI payment endpoints.
"""
# Expose functions at package root (Facade Pattern)
# In real files: from .orders import create_order
# In real files: from .payments import pay_via_upi

__version__ = "2.1.0"
__all__ = ["create_order", "pay_via_upi"]
```

Client script consuming the package facade:

```python
# =============================================================
# client_app.py
# =============================================================
# Notice how the client imports directly from the package facade!
cart_items = [
    {"name": "Python Mastery Book", "price": 850.0},
    {"name": "Mechanical Keyboard", "price": 3200.0}
]

# Clean facade access
my_order = create_order("Aarav Sharma", cart_items)
print("Order Placed:", my_order)

payment_receipt = pay_via_upi(my_order["order_id"], my_order["total_amount"], "aarav@oksbi")
print("Payment Receipt:", payment_receipt)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Order Placed: {'order_id': 'ORD-2026-9021', 'customer': 'Aarav Sharma', 'items_count': 2, 'total_amount': 4050.0}
Payment Receipt: {'status': 'PAID', 'txn_id': 'UPI-TXN-5544', 'order_id': 'ORD-2026-9021', 'amount': 4050.0, 'vpa': 'aarav@oksbi'}
```

### 2. Inspecting Package Introspection Attributes

Packages possess special attributes that provide structural insights:

```python
import os

# Packages report their filesystem location via __file__ and __path__
print("Is 'os' a package or module?", hasattr(os, "__path__"))

import json
print("Does 'json' have a __path__ attribute?", hasattr(json, "__path__"))
if hasattr(json, "__path__"):
    print("  json is a Package located at:", json.__path__)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Is 'os' a package or module? False
Does 'json' have a __path__ attribute? True
  json is a Package located at: ['C:\\Python312\\Lib\\json']
```

## Best Practices & Comparison: Do's and Don'ts

| Practice | Bad Implementation | Recommended Gold Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Usability** | Forcing users to import from deep nested files | Re-export key functions in `__init__.py` as a facade |
| **Wildcard Safety** | Leaving `__all__` undefined in `__init__.py` | Explicitly define `__all__ = [...]` for public symbols |
| **Relative Imports** | Using relative imports inside top-level scripts | Use relative imports only **inside** package submodules |
| **Circular Imports** | Cross-importing sibling submodules in `__init__` | Keep `__init__.py` lightweight; import on demand |
| **Execution** | Running submodules directly (`python pkg/mod.py`)| Run package modules using `-m` flag: `python -m pkg.mod` |

## Quick Revision Summary Cheat Sheet

- **Package:** A directory containing Python modules and typically an `__init__.py` file.
- **`__init__.py` Role:** Executes upon package import; used for package setup, version stamping (`__version__`), and facade re-exports.
- **Facade Pattern:** `from .submodule import feature` inside `__init__.py` flattens the user-facing import path.
- **`__all__` List:** A list of strings defining what symbols are imported when `from package import *` is called.
- **Relative Imports:** `.` denotes current directory package, `..` denotes parent directory package.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. What differentiates a Python Package from a standalone Python Module?
A. Modules are written in C, while packages are written in Python
B. A module is a single `.py` file, whereas a package is a directory that can contain multiple modules and sub-packages
C. Modules can only contain 1 function
D. Packages cannot be imported
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A module is an individual file (e.g. `utils.py`), while a package is a filesystem directory containing an `__init__.py` file along with multiple `.py` modules and nested sub-packages.

---

### 2. What is the primary purpose of writing from .engine import start_engine inside a package's __init__.py?
A. To prevent start_engine from ever being executed
B. To provide an API Facade, allowing users to import start_engine directly from the package root rather than drilling into internal submodules
C. To delete the engine.py file
D. To convert the function into a class
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Re-exporting functions in `__init__.py` implements the Facade pattern. Consumers write `from my_package import start_engine` instead of navigating deep internal directory hierarchies.

---

### 3. What does the __all__ variable in an __init__.py file control?
A. It defines which operating systems can run the package
B. It defines the explicit list of symbol names that will be exported when a consumer executes from package import *
C. It lists all author names
D. It lists all unit tests
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When wildcard import `from package import *` is invoked, Python checks `__all__`. Only strings present in the `__all__` sequence are imported into the caller's namespace.

---

### 4. What does the single dot (.) represent in from .auth import login?
A. The computer's root directory `C:\`
B. The current package / directory where the importing file resides
C. The parent directory of the current package
D. A syntax error
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In explicit relative imports, a single dot `.` refers to the current package/directory, while two dots `..` refer to the parent package.

---

### 5. Why does running python my_package/submodule.py directly often trigger an ImportError on relative imports?
A. Because relative imports require root administrative privileges
B. Because when a script is executed directly, Python sets `__name__` to `"__main__"` and loses context of the parent package hierarchy
C. Because Python requires `.exe` files
D. Because submodules cannot contain functions
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When run directly as the entry point, the file is not treated as part of an enclosing package. To execute a submodule with relative imports, invoke Python with the module flag: `python -m my_package.submodule`.

# Practice Challenge

### Scenario: Indian Logistics Shipping & Courier Tracking Package

Architect a clean package structure for an Indian express courier company (e.g. BlueDart / Delhivery):
1. Design simulated modules:
   - `courier.py`: Contains `estimate_delivery_time(origin_pincode, dest_pincode)`
   - `rates.py`: Contains `calculate_shipping_rate(weight_kg, is_express=False)`
2. In `__init__.py`, construct a **Facade**:
   - Re-export both functions so the client imports directly from the package root.
   - Define `__all__ = ["estimate_delivery_time", "calculate_shipping_rate"]`.
   - Set `__version__ = "1.0.0"`.
3. Demonstrate client execution calculating a 2.5 kg parcel from Mumbai (400001) to Bengaluru (560001).

### Starter Code
```python
# Build simulated package structure with facade re-exports and __all__
```

### Complete Solution
```python
# Simulated courier.py
def estimate_delivery_time(origin_pincode, dest_pincode):
    """Calculates transit days based on Indian postal zones."""
    origin_zone = str(origin_pincode)[0]
    dest_zone = str(dest_pincode)[0]
    if origin_zone == dest_zone:
        return "1-2 Business Days (Intra-Zone)"
    return "3-4 Business Days (Inter-State Express)"

# Simulated rates.py
def calculate_shipping_rate(weight_kg, is_express=False):
    """Calculates shipping charges in INR."""
    base_rate_per_kg = 80.0
    cost = weight_kg * base_rate_per_kg
    if is_express:
        cost *= 1.50  # 50% express air surcharge
    return round(cost, 2)

# Simulated __init__.py
__version__ = "1.0.0"
__all__ = ["estimate_delivery_time", "calculate_shipping_rate"]

# Client Consumption via Facade
print(f"=== Indian Express Logistics Suite (v{__version__}) ===")
origin = 400001  # Mumbai
dest = 560001    # Bengaluru
weight = 2.5     # kg

transit = estimate_delivery_time(origin, dest)
standard_cost = calculate_shipping_rate(weight, is_express=False)
express_cost = calculate_shipping_rate(weight, is_express=True)

print(f"Route           : {origin} (Mumbai) ➔ {dest} (Bengaluru)")
print(f"Estimated Time  : {transit}")
print(f"Standard Rate   : ₹{standard_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Express Air Rate: ₹{express_cost:.2f}")
```

### Expected Output
```text
=== Indian Express Logistics Suite (v1.0.0) ===
Route           : 400001 (Mumbai) ➔ 560001 (Bengaluru)
Estimated Time  : 3-4 Business Days (Inter-State Express)
Standard Rate   : ₹200.00
Express Air Rate: ₹300.00
```
