# Advanced List Comprehensions in Python

In beginner Python, you learned that a list comprehension provides a concise syntax for creating lists from iterables. However, in professional intermediate Python engineering, list comprehensions are far more than syntactic sugar: they compile into high-speed C-level bytecode instructions, flatten complex multi-dimensional datasets, evaluate sophisticated multi-predicate filters, and eliminate imperative boilerplate.

In this lesson, you will master advanced list comprehension patterns including nested iteration, conditional expressions, walrus operator optimization, and performance benchmarking against standard loops.

## Real-World Analogy: Automated Dabbawala Express Sorting Conveyor

Consider Mumbai's world-famous Dabbawalas sorting 200,000 lunchboxes across railway stations:

```

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|  Raw Crates ──> [ Outer Loop: Train Stations (Dadar, Churchgate, VT) ]  |
|                         │                                               |
|                         ▼                                               |
|                 [ Inner Loop: Dabbas in Station Crate ]                 |
|                         │                                               |

|                 [ Filter: Only Priority Corporate Delivery? ]           |
|                         │ (Yes)                                         |
|                         ▼                                               |

|                         │                                               |
|                         ▼                                               |

```

- **Traditional Loop:** A worker picks up each crate, inspects every tiffin individually, writes a delivery note by hand, and appends it to a manual register with repeated function calls.
- **Advanced List Comprehension:** An automated optical scanner and pneumatic sorting conveyor that inspects, filters, tags, and routes thousands of items simultaneously at hardware speed.

## Technical Syntax Architecture: The Dual-Condition Anatomy

An advanced list comprehension can contain two distinct types of conditionals in different positions:

```
[ <Transformation Expression>   for <item> in <iterable>   if <Filter Predicate> ]
          ▲                                                           ▲
          │                                                           │
   Ternary If/Else                                             Filtering If
(What value to put in list)                               (Whether to include item)
```

### Syntax Comparison Rule:
1. **Filtering condition (at the end):**
   `[x for x in data if x > 0]` $\to$ Only keeps positive numbers. No `else` allowed here!
2. **Transformation condition (at the start):**
   `[x if x > 0 else 0 for x in data]` $\to$ Keeps all items, but replaces negative numbers with `0`. Requires `else`!
3. **Combined:**
   `[x * 2 if x % 2 == 0 else x * 3 for x in data if x > 0]`

---

## CPython Bytecode & Performance Deep-Dive

Why are list comprehensions faster than standard `for` loops with `.append()`?

```python
import dis

def loop_approach(nums):
    result = []
    for x in nums:
        result.append(x * 2)
    return result

def comp_approach(nums):
    return [x * 2 for x in nums]
```

When disassembled with Python's `dis` module:
- The standard loop repeatedly executes `LOAD_METHOD (append)` and `CALL_METHOD` inside the Python virtual machine for every single iteration.
- The list comprehension uses a specialized C-level opcode `LIST_APPEND` that appends directly to the underlying C array without invoking Python method dispatch overhead!

---

## Comprehensive Code Examples

### 1. Multi-Condition Filtering & Chained Predicates

You can specify multiple `if` clauses sequentially. An item is included only if **all** conditions evaluate to `True` (equivalent to logical `and`).

```python
# Real-World Scenario: Indian E-Commerce Festival Discount Eligibility
customers = [
    {"name": "Aditi", "cart_value": 4500, "is_prime": True, "city": "Bengaluru"},
    {"name": "Rohan", "cart_value": 1200, "is_prime": False, "city": "Delhi"},
    {"name": "Kavita", "cart_value": 8900, "is_prime": True, "city": "Mumbai"},
    {"name": "Siddharth", "cart_value": 3100, "is_prime": False, "city": "Bengaluru"},
    {"name": "Pooja", "cart_value": 5200, "is_prime": True, "city": "Jaipur"}
]

# Select Prime customers with cart > Rs 4,000 living in Metro hubs (Mumbai or Bengaluru)
eligible_discounts = [
    c["name"].upper()
    for c in customers
    if c["is_prime"]
    if c["cart_value"] >= 4000
    if c["city"] in ("Mumbai", "Bengaluru")
]

print("Festival VIP Discount Recipients:", eligible_discounts)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Festival VIP Discount Recipients: ['ADITI', 'KAVITA']
```

---

### 2. Ternary Expressions Inside Comprehensions

When you need to transform elements differently depending on a condition without discarding items:

```python
# GST Tax Rate Classifier for Goods Ledger
item_prices = [45.0, 180.0, 1250.0, 890.0, 12.0]

# Rule: Items > Rs 500 get 18% GST; items <= Rs 500 get 5% GST
taxed_totals = [
    round(price * 1.18, 2) if price > 500 else round(price * 1.05, 2)
    for price in item_prices
]

print("Original Prices :", item_prices)
print("After GST Slabs :", taxed_totals)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Original Prices : [45.0, 180.0, 1250.0, 890.0, 12.0]
After GST Slabs : [47.25, 189.0, 1475.0, 1050.2, 12.6]
```

---

### 3. Flattening 2D Matrices and Multi-Level Iteration

Reading nested comprehensions can be tricky. Remember the fundamental golden rule:
> **The `for` clauses in a comprehension appear in the EXACT same order as nested `for` loops in standard Python.**

```python
# Standard Nested Loop order:
# for row in matrix:
#     for val in row:
#         ...

matrix = [
    [10, 20, 30],
    [40, 50, 60],
    [70, 80, 90]
]

# 1. Flatten entire 2D matrix into a 1D list
flattened = [val for row in matrix for val in row]
print("Flattened 1D List:", flattened)

# 2. Flatten and filter: only numbers greater than 40
filtered_flat = [val for row in matrix for val in row if val > 40]
print("Filtered Flattened (> 40):", filtered_flat)

# 3. Transpose a 3x3 matrix (swap rows and columns)
transposed = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(3)]
print("Transposed Matrix:")
for r in transposed:
    print(" ", r)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Flattened 1D List: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
Filtered Flattened (> 40): [50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
Transposed Matrix:
  [10, 40, 70]
  [20, 50, 80]
  [30, 60, 90]
```

### 4. Advanced Optimization: The Walrus Operator (`:=`) in Comprehensions

Introduced in Python 3.8, the assignment expression (`:=`) prevents computing expensive calculations twice—once for filtering and once for the output expression.

```python
# Simulated heavy calculation: tax calculation function
def calculate_luxury_cess(price):
    # Imagine this involves a complex database query or cryptographic check
    return price * 0.28 - 50.0

products = [150.0, 450.0, 1200.0, 2500.0, 320.0]

# ANTI-PATTERN: Calls calculate_luxury_cess(p) TWICE per item!
# [calculate_luxury_cess(p) for p in products if calculate_luxury_cess(p) > 100]

# GOLD STANDARD: Walrus assigns 'cess' once, reused in output and filter!
high_tax_items = [
    f"₹{cess:.2f}"
    for p in products
    if (cess := calculate_luxury_cess(p)) > 100.0
]

print("Expensive Cess Charges (> ₹100):", high_tax_items)
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Expensive Cess Charges (> ₹100): ['₹286.00', '₹650.00']
```

## Best Practices & Comparison: Do's and Don'ts

| Practice | Bad / Anti-Pattern | Recommended Gold Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Readability** | Nesting 4 levels of `for` loops inside 1 comprehension | If it spans > 2 lines or has complex side-effects, use standard loops |
| **Side Effects** | Using `[print(x) for x in data]` for printing | Use standard `for x in data: print(x)` |
| **Ternary Position** | Putting `if-else` at the end after `iterable` (SyntaxError) | `[A if cond else B for x in iter]` |
| **Re-evaluating Functions** | Calling expensive functions in both output & `if` filter | Use walrus operator `(val := func(x))` |
| **Memory Footprint** | Building a 5-million item list just to find the sum | Use generator expressions: `sum(x for x in large_data)` |

## Quick Revision Summary Cheat Sheet

- **Basic Filter:** `[expr for x in iterable if condition]`
- **Ternary Value Mapping:** `[expr_true if condition else expr_false for x in iterable]`
- **Matrix Flattening:** `[item for sublist in matrix for item in sublist]` (left-to-right matches outer-to-inner).
- **Matrix Transpose:** `[[row[col_idx] for row in matrix] for col_idx in range(cols)]`
- **Walrus Caching:** `[res for x in items if (res := expensive_fn(x)) > threshold]`
- **Performance:** Avoids Python method dispatch overhead by using C-level `LIST_APPEND` opcodes.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. In which position must a ternary if-else expression be placed inside a list comprehension?
A. At the very end after the iterable: `[x for x in data if x > 0 else 0]`
B. Before the `for` keyword: `[x if x > 0 else 0 for x in data]`
C. Inside parentheses around the entire comprehension
D. List comprehensions forbid ternary expressions completely
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When providing alternative values using `if-else`, it forms a conditional expression that must appear before the `for` keyword: `[val_if_true if condition else val_if_false for x in iterable]`. Placing `else` after the `for` loop causes a `SyntaxError`.

---

### 2. Given matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], what does the expression [val for row in matrix for val in row] produce?
A. `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
B. `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
C. `[1, 3, 2, 4]`
D. `[[1, 3], [2, 4]]`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Multi-loop comprehensions evaluate left-to-right. The outer loop `for row in matrix` runs first, followed by the inner loop `for val in row`, successfully flattening the 2D matrix into the 1D list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

---

### 3. Why is a list comprehension generally faster in CPython than a standard for-loop with .append()?
A. It bypasses CPU cache memory
B. It is compiled down to optimized C-level `LIST_APPEND` bytecode opcodes, avoiding repeated Python method lookup overhead
C. It runs on a secondary GPU thread automatically
D. It skips data type verification
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A standard `for` loop must look up `.append` on the list instance and execute Python function calling frames on every iteration. Comprehensions utilize the direct `LIST_APPEND` bytecode instruction implemented directly in C runtime.

---

### 4. How does the Walrus operator (:=) optimize list comprehensions that filter by expensive function results?
A. It compiles the function to machine code
B. It assigns the function return value to a temporary variable during filtering, avoiding a redundant second function call in the output expression
C. It suppresses all exceptions
D. It reverses the order of iteration
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Without the walrus operator, developers often call `func(x)` twice: once in the `if` filter and once in the projection expression. With `if (res := func(x)) > limit`, `res` is computed once and reused.

---

### 5. What is the output of the following comprehension?
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = [x * 10 for x in nums if x % 2 == 0 if x > 3]
print(result)
```
A. `[20, 40, 60]`
B. `[40, 60]`
C. `[10, 20, 30]`
D. `SyntaxError`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Chaining multiple `if` clauses acts as a logical `AND`. Only numbers that are both even (`x % 2 == 0`) AND strictly greater than 3 (`x > 3`) qualify. Out of `nums`, 4 and 6 satisfy both conditions, resulting in `[40, 60]`.

---

# Practice Challenge

### Scenario: High-Frequency Stock Trading Volume & Volatility Filter

At the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), daily stock tickers arrive formatted as a list of dictionaries with open, close, and volume data.

Write an advanced list comprehension that:
1. Calculates the absolute price percentage change: `abs(close - open) / open * 100`.
2. Filters only tickers where:
   - Volume is at least 500,000 shares (`volume >= 500000`).
   - Volatility percentage is greater than or equal to 3.0% (`pct_change >= 3.0`).
3. Uses the **walrus operator** (`:=`) so the percentage change formula is computed only once per ticker.
4. Returns a list of formatted strings: `"[TICKER] Up/Down: +X.X% / -X.X%"`.

### Starter Code
```python
market_feed = [
    {"ticker": "TCS", "open": 3800.0, "close": 3950.0, "volume": 650000},
    {"ticker": "INFY", "open": 1600.0, "close": 1610.0, "volume": 850000},
    {"ticker": "RELIANCE", "open": 2900.0, "close": 2780.0, "volume": 1200000},
    {"ticker": "HDFCBANK", "open": 1450.0, "close": 1452.0, "volume": 350000},
    {"ticker": "TATAMOTORS", "open": 980.0, "close": 1025.0, "volume": 900000},
]

# TODO: Write single advanced comprehension with walrus operator
```

### Complete Solution
```python
market_feed = [
    {"ticker": "TCS", "open": 3800.0, "close": 3950.0, "volume": 650000},
    {"ticker": "INFY", "open": 1600.0, "close": 1610.0, "volume": 850000},
    {"ticker": "RELIANCE", "open": 2900.0, "close": 2780.0, "volume": 1200000},
    {"ticker": "HDFCBANK", "open": 1450.0, "close": 1452.0, "volume": 350000},
    {"ticker": "TATAMOTORS", "open": 980.0, "close": 1025.0, "volume": 900000},
]

# Advanced comprehension with walrus operator and ternary formatting
volatile_movers = [
    f"[{s['ticker']}] Change: {pct:+.2f}% (Vol: {s['volume']:,})"
    for s in market_feed
    if s["volume"] >= 500000
    if (pct := ((s["close"] - s["open"]) / s["open"]) * 100) and abs(pct) >= 3.0
]

print("--- BSE Volatile High-Volume Movers ---")
for stock in volatile_movers:
    print(stock)
```

### Expected Output
```text
--- BSE Volatile High-Volume Movers ---
[TCS] Change: +3.95% (Vol: 650,000)
[RELIANCE] Change: -4.14% (Vol: 1,200,000)
[TATAMOTORS] Change: +4.59% (Vol: 900,000)
```
