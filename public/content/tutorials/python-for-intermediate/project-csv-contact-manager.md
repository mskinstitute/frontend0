# Project: CSV Contact Manager

In this hands-on project, we will apply the advanced file handling techniques covered in this chapter—including `csv.DictReader`, `csv.DictWriter`, context managers, and robust error handling—to build a persistent Command-Line **CSV Contact Manager**.

---

## 1. Project Specifications & Requirements

The application will manage contact records and save them to `contacts.csv`. Key capabilities:
1. **Data Persistence**: Automatically reads from and writes to a structured CSV file.
2. **Auto-Initialization**: Gracefully initializes the CSV file with headers if it does not yet exist.
3. **Core CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create**: Add new contacts with validation.
   - **Read**: Display all contacts in a formatted table.
   - **Search**: Case-insensitive search by name or category.
   - **Delete**: Remove a contact by name and rewrite the updated dataset.
4. **Safety**: Handles missing files, invalid inputs, and file permissions without crashing.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. In our Contact Manager, what happens if `contacts.csv` does not exist when the program boots?
A. The script crashes immediately with a `FileNotFoundError`
B. `initialize_storage()` creates the file and writes the header row using `csv.DictWriter`
C. Python waits for user input before attempting any file access
D. An in-memory SQLite database is used instead
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `initialize_storage()` checks if the file exists; if not, it opens the file with mode `'w'` and calls `writer.writeheader()` to establish the schema.
---

### 2. How does the `delete_contact()` function remove a record from the CSV file?
A. By seeking directly to the byte offset in the CSV file and issuing `f.truncate()`
B. By loading records into memory, filtering out the deleted entry, and rewriting the entire file
C. By writing an empty dictionary at the row index
D. The `csv` module does not support deleting records
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In standard sequential text/CSV files, deleting a record requires filtering the in-memory list of records and rewriting the updated collection with `save_contacts()`.
---

### 3. Why is `newline=''` supplied to `open()` during both load and save operations?
A. To convert single quotes to double quotes automatically
B. To ensure consistent line termination across Windows, Linux, and macOS without extra blank lines
C. To prevent Unicode characters from being parsed
D. To disable buffering for faster disk writes
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The `newline=''` argument ensures Python's file object delegates all newline translation to the CSV reader/writer, preventing unwanted blank lines on Windows platforms.
---

### 4. Which method of `csv.DictWriter` writes all dictionary rows in a single step?
A. `writer.dump_all()`
B. `writer.write_batch()`
C. `writer.writerows()`
D. `writer.save()`
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `writer.writerows(iterable_of_dicts)` accepts an iterable of row dictionaries and writes them all into the CSV file.
---

### 5. Why is `csv.DictReader` preferred over index-based `csv.reader` for storing entities with multiple attributes like contacts?
A. `DictReader` is written in C and runs 10x faster
B. Attributes can be accessed safely by column name (e.g. `c['phone']`), making the code resilient to column reordering
C. `DictReader` encrypts user passwords automatically
D. `DictReader` handles binary image files
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `DictReader` accesses values by header names instead of fixed integer indices, preventing bugs when columns are added, removed, or reordered in the CSV file.
