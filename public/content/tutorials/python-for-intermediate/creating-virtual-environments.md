# Creating and Managing Virtual Environments in Python

Python provides the built-in **`venv`** module in its standard library to create lightweight, isolated virtual environments. In this guide, we cover the exact command-line steps to generate, activate, verify, and deactivate virtual environments across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project's root folder, and execute the `venv` module:

```bash
# Standard command: python -m venv <directory_name>
python -m venv .venv
```

*(On some Linux/macOS systems, you may type `python3 -m venv .venv`)*.

### Why name it `.venv`?
- The leading dot `.` makes the directory hidden on UNIX systems.
- Industry-standard code editors (like VS Code and PyCharm) automatically detect `.venv` and prompt you to select it as your project's active interpreter.
- Popular Git templates automatically ignore `.venv/`.

## 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Activation modifies your active shell session's `PATH` environment variable so that typing `python` or `pip` runs the executables inside your `.venv` directory instead of global system executables.

The activation script depends on your operating system and shell:

### 1. Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
> **PowerShell Execution Policy Error Fix:**
> If Windows blocks the script with `Execution_Policies` restriction, allow scripts for the current terminal session:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
> .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
> ```

### 2. Windows (Command Prompt - CMD)
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 3. macOS and Linux (Bash / Zsh)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. How to Know Your Environment is Active

When successfully activated:
1. **Shell Prompt Prefix**: Your terminal prompt will display the environment name in parentheses:
   ```bash
   (.venv) C:\Users\Dev\Project>
   ```
2. **Interpreter Path**: Verifying the path confirms it points to your `.venv` directory:
   - On Windows: `where python` $\rightarrow$ `...\Project\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
   - On Linux/macOS: `which python` $\rightarrow$ `.../Project/.venv/bin/python`

3. **Python Runtime Verification**:
   ```python
   import sys
   print(sys.prefix)  # Displays path to your local .venv directory!
   ```

## 4. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you finish working on your project, return your shell back to the global system environment by simply typing:

```bash
deactivate
```
The `(.venv)` prefix disappears immediately from your prompt.

## 5. Golden Rule of Version Control: The `.gitignore`

> **CRITICAL RULE:**
> **NEVER** commit your virtual environment folder (`.venv/`) to Git, GitHub, or any version control system!
> Virtual environments contain thousands of platform-specific binary executables and C-extensions compiled specifically for your exact operating system and CPU architecture.

Always add `.venv` to your project's `.gitignore` file:

```text
# .gitignore
.venv/
venv/
env/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

Instead of committing the environment itself, you commit the **dependency specification** (`requirements.txt`), allowing collaborators to recreate the environment on their own machines with a single command.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Which standard module is used to create virtual environments in modern Python?
A. `virtualenv_cli`
B. `venv`
C. `pyenv`
D. `isolate`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The built-in standard library module for creating virtual environments is `venv` (e.g. `python -m venv .venv`).
---

### 2. How do you activate a virtual environment named `.venv` in macOS/Linux terminal?
A. `python activate .venv`
B. `source .venv/bin/activate`
C. `run .venv/activate`
D. `start .venv`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** On UNIX-like systems (Linux and macOS), running `source .venv/bin/activate` executes the activation shell script in the current environment context.
---

### 3. What visual cue indicates that a virtual environment is currently active in your terminal?
A. The terminal background color turns blue
B. The name of the environment appears in parentheses at the start of the command prompt (e.g. `(.venv)`)
C. A pop-up notification appears
D. The terminal window title says "Root"
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The activation script modifies the shell prompt string to prepend the environment name in parentheses, such as `(.venv)`.
---

### 4. Which command returns your shell session from an active virtual environment back to the global environment?
A. `exit`
B. `stop`
C. `deactivate`
D. `kill`
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The `deactivate` shell function restores original `PATH` variables and exits the virtual environment.
---

### 5. Why should virtual environment directories (`.venv/`) NEVER be committed to Git?
A. Git does not support directories with a leading dot
B. Virtual environments contain platform-specific compiled binaries and machine-dependent paths that will not work on other computers
C. Virtual environment folders exceed GitHub's single-file limit
D. Virtual environments are encrypted
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Virtual environments contain machine-specific binaries, symlinks, and absolute paths tailored exclusively to the host system. They should be generated locally and never checked into version control.
