# SQLite Installation & Setup in Python

One of Python's greatest superpowers is its "batteries-included" philosophy. Unlike many languages that require installing third-party drivers or setting up external database servers, Python comes pre-bundled with a complete, production-ready SQL database engine via the **`sqlite3`** standard library module.

---

## 1. Verifying the Built-in `sqlite3` Module

No `pip install` command is required! You can import `sqlite3` and inspect its engine version directly:

```python
import sqlite3

# Inspect Python interface version and SQLite C-library engine version
print(f"Python sqlite3 module version: {sqlite3.version}")
print(f"Underlying SQLite C-library version: {sqlite3.sqlite_version}")
```

## 2. File-Backed vs. In-Memory Databases

SQLite supports two distinct operating modes:

### 1. File-Backed Database (Persistent Storage)
Data is saved to a persistent disk file. If the file does not exist, SQLite automatically creates it upon the first connection:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to a physical file (creates 'company.db' if absent)
conn = sqlite3.connect("company.db")
print("Connected to persistent database: company.db")

# Always close connections when finished
conn.close()
```

### 2. In-Memory Database (Lightning-Fast Ephemeral Storage)
By passing the special string `":memory:"`, SQLite creates a fully functional SQL database strictly in RAM. It leaves zero disk artifacts and is discarded when the connection terminates—making it ideal for automated test suites:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to temporary RAM database
mem_conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
print("Connected to high-speed in-memory database.")
mem_conn.close()
```

## 3. SQLite's Native Storage Classes (Type Affinity)

While traditional SQL engines (like PostgreSQL or SQL Server) enforce rigid static column types, SQLite uses a flexible **Dynamic Typing (Type Affinity)** model with five primary storage classes:

| Storage Class | Description | Python Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`NULL`** | Missing or null value | `None` |
| **`INTEGER`** | Signed integer (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes) | `int` |
| **`REAL`** | Floating point value (8-byte IEEE floating point) | `float` |
| **`TEXT`** | Text string (UTF-8, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE) | `str` |
| **`BLOB`** | Binary Large Object (stored exactly as input) | `bytes` |

## 4. Helpful GUI Viewers for SQLite

While your Python code handles database operations programmatically, visualizing tables during development is helpful:

1. **DB Browser for SQLite** ([sqlitebrowser.org](https://sqlitebrowser.org)): A popular, open-source, visual desktop application for inspecting schemas, running ad-hoc queries, and editing table data.
2. **VS Code SQLite Viewer Extension**: Allows clicking on any `.db` file in the VS Code explorer to view and query tables directly inside your IDE editor.
3. **SQLite CLI**: The native command-line utility for managing SQLite databases from your terminal.

## 5. First Schema Creation Test

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to database file
connection = sqlite3.connect("test_setup.db")

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute table creation DDL
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS system_config (
    config_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    config_value TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
""")

# Commit changes to disk and close
connection.commit()
connection.close()

print("Database and table successfully initialized!")
```

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Which command is used to install SQLite support for Python?
A. `pip install sqlite3`
B. `pip install python-sqlite`
C. No installation is required; `sqlite3` is built into Python's standard library
D. `npm install sqlite`
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Python includes the `sqlite3` module as part of its standard library, so no installation or external packages are necessary.
---

### 2. How do you create an ultra-fast, temporary SQLite database located entirely in RAM?
A. `sqlite3.connect("temp.ram")`
B. `sqlite3.connect(":memory:")`
C. `sqlite3.connect(None)`
D. `sqlite3.in_memory()`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Passing the special URI string `":memory:"` creates an ephemeral database entirely in system RAM.
---

### 3. Which of the following is NOT one of SQLite's 5 native storage classes?
A. `BLOB`
B. `TEXT`
C. `BOOLEAN`
D. `REAL`
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** SQLite does not have a distinct `BOOLEAN` storage class; boolean values are typically stored as `INTEGER` (0 for false, 1 for true).
---

### 4. What is the role of `connection.commit()` in SQLite?
A. It compresses the database tables
B. It flushes and saves the active transaction's pending changes permanently to disk
C. It disconnects from the database
D. It drops duplicate rows
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `commit()` saves all pending modifications made during the transaction to permanent storage.
---

### 5. What object must be created from a `Connection` to execute SQL queries and fetch results?
A. `connection.stream()`
B. `connection.cursor()`
C. `connection.executor()`
D. `connection.query_handler()`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The `Cursor` object (`connection.cursor()`) is responsible for executing SQL statements and traversing result sets.
