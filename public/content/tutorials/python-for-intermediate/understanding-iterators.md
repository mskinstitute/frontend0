# Understanding Iterators in Python

Iteration is one of the most fundamental operations in Python. Whenever you write `for item in sequence:`, Python leverages the **Iterator Protocol** behind the scenes. Understanding how iterables and iterators function under the hood allows you to process massive datasets memory-efficiently and master advanced Python data patterns.

## 1. Iterable vs. Iterator: The Core Distinction

Many developers conflate iterables and iterators, but they are distinct concepts in Python:

- **Iterable**: An object that can return an iterator. Any collection that defines an `__iter__()` method (or implements sequence indexing via `__getitem__()`) is an iterable. Examples: `list`, `tuple`, `str`, `dict`, `set`.
- **Iterator**: A stateful object representing a stream of data. It yields consecutive items one at a time when `__next__()` is called and maintains its current position in the sequence.

```python
# A list is an ITERABLE, not an iterator
fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana"]

# We obtain an ITERATOR from the iterable using iter()
fruit_iterator = iter(fruits)
print(type(fruit_iterator))  # <class 'list_iterator'>

# Extract elements one by one using next()
print(next(fruit_iterator))  # Apple
print(next(fruit_iterator))  # Mango
print(next(fruit_iterator))  # Banana

# Calling next() again raises StopIteration
try:
    print(next(fruit_iterator))
except StopIteration:
    print("Iterator exhausted!")
```

## 2. The Iterator Protocol

The Python **Iterator Protocol** consists of two methods:

1. **`__iter__()`**: Must return the iterator object itself (`return self`).
2. **`__next__()`**: Returns the next item in the stream. When no elements remain, it must raise the `StopIteration` exception.

```text
+-------------------+      iter(iterable)      +-------------------+
|     Iterable      | -----------------------> |     Iterator      |
| (list, dict, str) |                          | (stateful stream) |
+-------------------+                          +-------------------+
                                                         |
                                                  next(iterator)
                                                         |
                                                         v
                                              Yields value OR raises
                                                  StopIteration
```

## 3. How the `for` Loop Actually Works Under the Hood

When you execute a standard `for` loop in Python:

```python
for item in [10, 20, 30]:
    print(item)
```

Python actually translates it into this precise `while` loop logic:

```python
# Equivalent lower-level execution of a for-loop:
collection = [10, 20, 30]
iterator = iter(collection)  # 1. Obtain the iterator

while True:
    try:
        item = next(iterator)  # 2. Fetch the next value
    except StopIteration:      # 3. Intercept end-of-stream cleanly
        break
    else:
        print(item)            # 4. Execute the loop body
```

---

## 4. Supplying a Default Value to `next()`

The built-in `next()` function accepts an optional second argument: a default fallback value. If the iterator is exhausted, `next()` returns this default value instead of raising `StopIteration`:

```python
stream = iter([1, 2])

print(next(stream, "DONE"))  # 1
print(next(stream, "DONE"))  # 2
print(next(stream, "DONE"))  # DONE (No exception raised!)
print(next(stream, "DONE"))  # DONE
```

This pattern is widely used in search algorithms and queue consumption to retrieve the first matching element safely.

## 5. Iterators are One-Way and Exhaustible

Unlike lists which can be indexed repeatedly, iterators are **stateful, forward-only, and single-use**. Once consumed, they cannot be rewound or reset:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
num_iter = iter(numbers)

# Consume iterator
sum1 = sum(num_iter)  # 6
sum2 = sum(num_iter)  # 0! The iterator is already exhausted!
print(f"First sum: {sum1}, Second sum: {sum2}")
```

To iterate over the elements again, you must generate a fresh iterator by calling `iter(numbers)` anew.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Which special method must an object implement to be classified as an iterable in Python?
A. `__next__()`
B. `__iter__()`
C. `__loop__()`
D. `__step__()`
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** An iterable must implement `__iter__()` (or `__getitem__()`), which returns an iterator instance when called.
---

### 2. Which exception signals that an iterator has reached the end of its elements?
A. `EOFError`
B. `IndexError`
C. `StopIteration`
D. `StreamExhaustedError`
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Python's Iterator Protocol mandates raising `StopIteration` when there are no further items to yield.
---

### 3. What is the second argument in `next(my_iter, "Empty")` used for?
A. To set the step size for iteration
B. To provide a fallback value when the iterator is exhausted instead of raising `StopIteration`
C. To limit maximum execution time
D. To convert items into strings
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Passing a default parameter to `next()` prevents `StopIteration` and returns the default value once the stream is exhausted.
---

### 4. What happens when you pass an already consumed iterator to another `for` loop?
A. The loop resets and prints all items from the beginning
B. The loop terminates immediately without executing its body
C. A `RuntimeError` is raised
D. Python re-indexes the underlying memory
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Iterators are single-use and maintain their consumed state. An exhausted iterator immediately raises `StopIteration`, causing subsequent loops to finish immediately.
---

### 5. Why do iterators provide substantial memory benefits compared to large lists?
A. Iterators compress data on disk
B. Iterators compute/produce elements on-demand (lazily) rather than allocating the entire sequence in memory at once
C. Iterators compile directly to assembly
D. Iterators only store integers
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Iterators evaluate lazily, keeping only the current element and internal pointer in RAM, whereas a list stores all elements in memory simultaneously.
