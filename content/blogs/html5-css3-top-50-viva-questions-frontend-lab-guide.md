Web Design and Internet Technology practical exams are mandatory for university degrees (BCA, B.Sc IT, B.Tech CSE) and government diplomas (NIELIT O Level M2-R5). During external lab vivas, examiners evaluate whether you understand **browser rendering mechanics, layout algorithms, accessibility, and modern CSS3 architectures** beyond basic tag memorization.

Here is an essential guide to the top 50 HTML5 and CSS3 viva questions, compiled by **Er. Sumit Kumar** at MSK Institute.

## 1. What is the DOCTYPE declaration and why is `<!DOCTYPE html>` essential?

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is **not** an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about the version of the HTML standard the document is written in.

- In HTML5, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is case-insensitive, clean, and concise.
- **Why it matters:** Without it, modern browsers drop into **"Quirks Mode"**, emulating outdated 1990s Netscape/Internet Explorer rendering bugs, which shatters modern CSS layouts.

---

## 2. What are Semantic Elements in HTML5 and why are they preferred over `<div>`?

Semantic tags clearly describe their meaning and purpose to both the browser and developer:

- **Non-semantic tags:** `<div>`, `<span>` (tell nothing about their content).
- **Semantic tags:** `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`.

### 3 Major Advantages:
1. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Google web crawlers prioritize content inside `<article>` and `<main>` over generic wrapper divs.
2. **Accessibility (a11y):** Screen readers used by visually impaired users use semantic landmarks to jump directly to primary page content.
3. **Clean Code Maintenance:** Developers instantly understand the structural hierarchy of the codebase.

## 3. Explain the CSS Box Model (With Diagram)

Every visible element in HTML is treated as a rectangular box by the browser rendering engine. From inside to outside:

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
|                    Margin                       |
|   +-----------------------------------------+   |
|   |                 Border                  |   |
|   |   +---------------------------------+   |   |
|   |   |             Padding             |   |   |
|   |   |   +-------------------------+   |   |   |
|   |   |   |     Content (Width)     |   |   |   |
|   |   |   +-------------------------+   |   |   |
|   |   +---------------------------------+   |   |
|   +-----------------------------------------+   |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Content:** The text, image, or video itself.
- **Padding:** Clear space around the content, *inside* the border (inherits element background color).
- **Border:** A stroke enclosing the padding and content.
- **Margin:** Transparent space *outside* the border separating the element from neighboring elements.

> **Examiner Trick Question:** *"What does `box-sizing: border-box;` do?"*  
> **Answer:** By default (`content-box`), adding padding expands the element's actual rendered width. With `box-sizing: border-box;`, padding and border are included **inside** the specified width and height, preventing layout breakage!

## 4. What is the Difference Between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid?

| Feature | CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box) | CSS Grid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dimension** | **1-Dimensional** (Row OR Column at a time) | **2-Dimensional** (Rows AND Columns simultaneously) |
| **Philosophy** | Content-first (Items dictate placement) | Layout-first (Predefined grid tracks dictate placement) |
| **Best Used For** | Navigation bars, button groups, vertical centering | Full-page layouts, photo galleries, dashboard widget grids |
| **Alignment** | `justify-content`, `align-items` | `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `gap` |

```css
/* Flexbox: Center anything in 3 lines */
.center-box {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Grid: 3-column responsive card layout */
.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
}
```

## 5. What are the CSS `position` Properties?

1. **`static`:** Default for all elements. Follows natural document flow. (`top/left/right/bottom` do nothing).
2. **`relative`:** Positioned relative to its normal position without affecting sibling elements.
3. **`absolute`:** Positioned relative to its **closest positioned ancestor** (an ancestor with any position other than `static`). Removed from normal flow.
4. **`fixed`:** Positioned relative to the **viewport browser window**. Stays fixed on screen during scrolling (used for sticky headers or floating WhatsApp chat buttons).
5. **`sticky`:** Hybrid of relative and fixed. Acts relative until a scroll threshold is met, then "sticks" to the screen.

---

## 6. What is the Difference Between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`?

- **`display: none;`:** Completely removes the element from the document rendering flow. It takes up **zero space** on the screen.
- **`visibility: hidden;`:** Hides the element visually, but **its layout space is preserved** as a blank placeholder.

---

## 7. How Does CSS Specificity Work? (Calculation Formula)

When two conflicting CSS rules target the same element, the browser uses **Specificity Hierarchy**:

$$\text{Inline Styles (1000)} > \text{IDs (100)} > \text{Classes / Attributes / Pseudo-classes (10)} > \text{Elements / Pseudo-elements (1)}$$

> **Important:** The `!important` rule overrides all normal specificity, but overusing it makes code unmaintainable.
