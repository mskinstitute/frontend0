Whether you are appearing for your BCA/B.Tech practical viva exam or preparing for your first software developer technical interview, Python is one of the most frequently tested languages. Here is a curated collection of the most critical conceptual and coding questions, compiled by Er. Sumit Kumar at MSK Institute.

## 1. What is Python and what makes it dynamically typed?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Unlike statically typed languages like C++ or Java where variable types must be declared explicitly, Python dynamically determines the variable type at runtime based on the assigned value.

```python
# Dynamically typed example
x = 10        # x is an integer
x = "Hello"   # x is now a string (no compile error!)
```

## 2. What is the fundamental difference between a List and a Tuple?

The single most common viva question!

- **Lists** are **mutable** (items can be modified, appended, or removed after creation) and defined using square brackets `[]`.
- **Tuples** are **immutable** (read-only after creation) and defined using parentheses `()`. Because tuples are immutable, they are faster and memory-efficient.

```python
# List vs Tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 99  # Valid! Lists are mutable.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[0] = 99  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

> **Pro Tip:** If you need to store constant records like GPS coordinates or institute roll numbers that shouldn't change, always use a Tuple.

## 3. What is a List Comprehension and why is it preferred?

List comprehension provides an elegant, concise syntax to create new lists from existing iterables. It replaces verbose 4-line for-loops with a single readable line.

```python
# Traditional Loop
squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

# Pythonic List Comprehension
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 6)]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## 4. How does Python handle memory management?

Python uses a private heap space managed by the **Python Memory Manager**. It features automated **Garbage Collection (GC)** based on:
1. **Reference Counting:** Every object tracks how many variables point to it. When the count hits 0, it deallocates instantly.
2. **Cyclic Garbage Collector:** Detects and cleans circular references that reference counting misses.

> **Try It Live:** Test and practice running Python code in our free browser compiler at [MSK Code Playground](/playground).

## 5. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

- A **shallow copy** (`copy.copy()`) creates a new container object, but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. Changes to nested objects affect both!
- A **deep copy** (`copy.deepcopy()`) recursively clones all nested objects, ensuring that modifications to the copy never alter the original data.

```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
shallow = copy.copy(original)
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

original[0][0] = 999
print(shallow[0][0])  # 999 (affected!)
print(deep[0][0])     # 1 (safe and independent!)
```

## 6. What is a Python Decorator?

A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of a function or class method without permanently modifying its source code. Decorators wrap another function using `@decorator_name` syntax.

```python
def log_execution(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Executing: {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_execution
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## 7. What are Generators and the `yield` keyword?

Generators are functions that return an iterator and yield items one at a time using `yield` rather than returning all values into memory at once with `return`. This allows iterating over huge datasets with near-zero memory footprint.

## 8. What is the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?

The GIL is a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) used by CPython to ensure that only one native thread executes Python bytecode at any given time, preventing race conditions with CPython's memory management. For CPU-bound parallel workloads, Python developers use `multiprocessing` instead of `threading`.

## Summary & Next Steps

Mastering these core principles will give you a massive confidence boost in both campus viva exams and corporate interviews. Join our live hands-on Python classes at MSK Institute in Shikohabad or online to build real-world portfolio projects under direct mentor guidance.
